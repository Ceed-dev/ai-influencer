## Session History

### 2026-02-06: Project Initialization (v1.0)

**What was done:**
- Created project folder structure
- Created initial documentation (README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, CONTEXT.md)
- Defined GAS project structure with component breakdown
- Established Google Sheets schema for multi-platform metrics

**Key decisions:**
1. **GAS over GCP VM**: Chose Google Apps Script for simplicity and native Sheets integration
2. **video_uid linking**: Each video gets a unique ID to link across platforms
3. **CSV-first approach**: Platform APIs have severe limitations. CSV export is the primary data source

### 2026-02-06: Phase 2-5 Implementation (v1.0)

**What was done:**
- CSV parsers, normalizers, linkers, KPI engine, LLM analyzer, sheet writer
- 223 tests across 6 test suites
- n8n integration documentation
- Sample CSV files

### 2026-02-09: Complete v2.0 Rebuild

**Why v2.0 was needed:**
- v1.0 was analytics-only (CSV import and analysis). It had no concept of video production lifecycle, no component management, and no way to track which content elements contributed to performance.
- v2.0 adds the complete production loop: component inventories, production workflow, approval gates, component-aware AI analysis, and performance scoring.

**What was done:**

- **Phase 1: Foundation**
  - `Config.gs` - Complete rewrite with Drive structure, master columns, component types, ID prefixes, KPI defaults, column aliases, dropdown options, colors
  - `Utils.gs` - Added readSheetAsObjects, findRowByColumn, findAllRowsByColumn, updateRowByIndex, ID generators (generateVideoUid, generateComponentId, generateScenarioId, generateMotionId, generateCharacterId, generateAudioId), getInventoryTypeFromId, getComponentById, getComponentsById
  - `Setup.gs` - One-click system setup: creates Drive folders (Scenarios/Motions/Characters/Audio/Analytics with subfolders), inventory spreadsheets (4 separate spreadsheets), all master sheet tabs, demo data, KPI defaults, formatting (dropdowns, conditional colors, checkbox)
  - `Migration.gs` - v1 to v2 migration (renames videos_master to master, adds new columns, creates video_analysis sheet, updates recommendations schema)

- **Phase 2: Data Layer**
  - `ComponentManager.gs` (NEW) - Component CRUD (addComponent, updateComponent, archiveComponent), listComponents with filters (type/status/tags), getTopPerformingComponents, buildVideoComponentContext, incrementComponentUsage, getComponentPerformanceHistory, buildRecommendationComponentPool
  - `MasterManager.gs` (NEW) - Master sheet operations (createProduction, getVideosByStatus, getApprovedVideos, getProductionData), production workflow (updateVideoStatus, approveVideo), updateMetricsSnapshot, writeAIRecommendations, updateAnalysisResults, getAllVideoUids, getMasterData
  - `ScoreUpdater.gs` (NEW) - updateAllComponentScores, calculateAvgScore, updateComponentScoresForVideo, updateSingleComponentScore, normalizeOverallScore, getScoreSummary

- **Phase 3: Analysis Extension**
  - `LLMAnalyzer.gs` - Rewritten with component-aware prompts (analyzWithLLMEnhanced), includes component history and top performers in AI context, generates component-specific recommendations via separate prompt, single-video analysis with component context
  - `Linker.gs` - Updated for v2.0 master sheet references, added updateMasterMetricsSnapshot
  - `KPIEngine.gs` - Added normalizeOverallScore for cross-platform scoring
  - `SheetWriter.gs` - Added writeToInventory, writeVideoAnalysis, writeRecommendationsEnhanced, clearAllData

- **Phase 4: Integration**
  - `Code.gs` - Complete rewrite with 13 API actions (doGet: get_status, get_approved, get_production, get_components, get_score_summary; doPost: import_csv, analyze, analyze_single, analyze_all, link_videos, create_production, approve_video, update_status, add_component, update_component, get_components, update_scores)
  - UI menu with submenus: Import CSV (YouTube/TikTok/Instagram), Analyze (Single/All), Production (Create/Approve/Status), Components (Add/Browse/Scores)

- **Phase 5: Testing**
  - 3 new test files: ComponentManager.test.js, MasterManager.test.js, ScoreUpdater.test.js
  - Updated all existing tests for v2.0 (master sheet references, removed scenario_cuts)
  - Updated setup.js with all v2.0 utility mocks
  - **330 tests passing across 9 test suites**

- **Phase 6: Documentation**
  - Updated all documentation for v2.0

**Key v2.0 decisions:**
1. **Separate inventory spreadsheets**: Each component type (scenarios, motions, characters, audio) has its own spreadsheet, accessed via `SpreadsheetApp.openById()`
2. **Component ID system**: Prefix-based (SCN_H_, SCN_B_, SCN_C_, MOT_, CHR_, AUD_) for type identification
3. **Production workflow**: draft -> approved -> in_production -> published -> analyzed, with human approval gate
4. **Component-aware AI analysis**: AI receives full component context (history, scores, top performers) when analyzing

### 2026-02-09: v2.0.1 - Checkbox Bug Fix

**Problem:** The `human_approved` checkbox column in the master sheet was causing `getLastRow()` to return 101 instead of 2 (or the actual data row count), because `requireCheckbox()` data validation auto-fills `FALSE` into empty cells, making them appear as data rows.

**Fix:** Changed `applyMasterSheetFormatting_()` to only apply checkbox validation to rows that have actual data (checked `sheet.getLastRow()` before applying), rather than applying to a range of 100 rows.

**Commit:** `62f7400 Fix insertDemoData false positive: checkbox FALSE values triggered data check`

### 2026-02-09: v2.0.2 - appendRow Bug Fix

**Problem:** Because of the checkbox FALSE values filling up to row 101, `sheet.appendRow()` was writing new data at row 102 instead of the next available row after actual data.

**Fix:** Updated `insertDemoData()` to clear any existing rows (including checkbox FALSE values) before writing demo data, and then apply checkbox validation only to the data rows.

**Commit:** `4c36712 Fix checkbox causing appendRow to write at row 101 instead of row 2`

### 2026-02-09: v2.0.3 - Config Sheet Fallback for API Keys

**Problem:** Setting Script Properties via the Apps Script editor is cumbersome, especially for the OpenAI API key. The `_config` sheet in the spreadsheet provides a more accessible way to store configuration.

**What changed:**
- `Config.gs`: Added `getConfigFromSheet_()` function that reads from a `_config` sheet (columns: key, value, description) as a fallback when Script Properties are not set
- `Config.gs`: Added `migrateConfigToProperties()` to migrate _config sheet values to Script Properties
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` now reads from Script Properties first, then falls back to `_config` sheet

### 2026-02-09: v2.0.4 - Web App Access Configuration

**Problem:** The Web App was not accessible externally because `appsscript.json` had `oauthScopes` configured (for bound script) but no `webapp` section. The webapp needed to be accessible without authentication for n8n integration.

**What changed:**
- `appsscript.json`: Replaced `oauthScopes` array with `webapp` configuration:
  ```json
  "webapp": {
    "access": "ANYONE_ANONYMOUS",
    "executeAs": "USER_DEPLOYING"
  }
  ```
- This allows anyone with the deployment URL to access the Web App endpoints
- OAuth scopes are inferred automatically by GAS for bound scripts

### 2026-02-09: OAuth Setup for Google Sheets/Drive API

**Purpose:** Enable Claude Code to directly read/write to Google Sheets and Drive for E2E testing and debugging.

**What was set up:**
- Created OAuth 2.0 credentials in Google Cloud Console (project: video-analytics-hub)
- Created `scripts/gsheet.py` CLI utility for direct Sheets/Drive API access
- Token stored in `.gsheets_token.json` (gitignored)
- OAuth client credentials in `video_analytics_hub_claude_code_oauth.json` (gitignored)
- MCP servers configured in `.mcp.json` for google-workspace and google-sheets integration (gitignored)

### 2026-02-09: E2E Testing Results

**End-to-end testing was performed against the live spreadsheet:**
- Confirmed all 9 sheet tabs exist with correct headers
- Confirmed master sheet has 3 demo videos (2 analyzed, 1 draft)
- Confirmed metrics sheets have data for analyzed videos
- Confirmed KPI targets are set with default values
- Confirmed component inventories are connected and populated with demo data
- All 330 unit tests pass

### 2026-02-09: LLM Analysis Execution (Live Test)

**Live test of the analysis pipeline was verified:**
- OpenAI API key configured via `_config` sheet (auto-migrated to Script Properties)
- `analyzeVideoSingle` and `analyzeAllVideosEnhanced` functions tested via GAS editor execution
- Analysis writes to `video_analysis` and `recommendations` sheets
- Component scores updated after analysis
- AI-recommended components written to `ai_next_*` columns

### 2026-02-09: MANUAL.md Creation

**Created comprehensive Japanese-language user manual (`MANUAL.md`):**
- Complete system overview with architecture diagrams (ASCII art)
- Detailed Google Drive data structure documentation
- All spreadsheet schemas with column descriptions
- Component management workflows
- Video production lifecycle documentation
- CSV import procedures for all 3 platforms
- Analysis and KPI explanation
- AI recommendation and approval flow
- n8n/API integration guide with all endpoint specifications
- GAS menu operation guide
- Troubleshooting section
- Initial setup instructions

### 2026-02-09: v2.1.0 - Documentation Update and .gitignore Hardening

**What was done:**
- Updated CONTEXT.md with complete project history
- Added `.mcp.json` and `tmp/` to `.gitignore` to prevent credential leaks
- Verified all documentation files are consistent with v2.0 codebase
- Committed, pushed, and deployed to Apps Script

### 2026-02-09: v3.0.0 - AI-Influencer Pipeline

**Why:** Pivot from analytics-only tool to a full content production pipeline. The existing GAS analytics (v2.0) handles post-publication analysis well, but the upstream workflow (video generation → platform posting) was manual via n8n. This version adds an automated Node.js pipeline to handle end-to-end content production at scale (50 → 700 accounts).

**What was done:**

- **Project restructure**: Renamed conceptually from "Video Analytics Hub" to "AI-Influencer" to reflect the broader scope
- **Created `pipeline/` directory** with modular Node.js architecture:
  - `pipeline/config.js` - Environment configuration and API key management
  - `pipeline/orchestrator.js` - Pipeline orchestration (scenario → video → post)
  - `pipeline/sheets/reader.js` - Google Sheets API reader (scenarios, accounts)
  - `pipeline/sheets/writer.js` - Google Sheets API writer (pipeline status, results)
  - `pipeline/media/kling.js` - fal.ai Kling video generation
  - `pipeline/media/tts.js` - fal.ai ElevenLabs TTS
  - `pipeline/media/lipsync.js` - fal.ai Lipsync processing
  - `pipeline/media/creatify.js` - Creatify video composition
  - `pipeline/storage/drive.js` - Google Drive upload/management
  - `pipeline/posting/youtube.js` - YouTube Data API v3 posting
  - `pipeline/posting/instagram.js` - Instagram Graph API posting
  - `pipeline/posting/tiktok.js` - TikTok Content Posting API
  - `pipeline/posting/x.js` - X/Twitter v2 API posting
- **Created `scripts/` entry points**:
  - `scripts/run-pipeline.js` - Single video pipeline execution
  - `scripts/run-daily.js` - Daily batch execution for all accounts
  - `scripts/collect-metrics.js` - Metrics collection from platforms
- **New Google Sheets tabs designed**:
  - `accounts` - Platform account management (account_id, platform, credentials_ref, status, daily limits)
  - `content_pipeline` - Pipeline execution log (pipeline_id, video_uid, account_id, job IDs, status, cost)
- **Documentation rewrite**:
  - `STRATEGY.md` (NEW) - Strategy, KPI targets, revenue model, meeting notes, decision log
  - `README.md` - Complete rewrite for AI-Influencer scope
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete rewrite with Pipeline + Analytics architecture
  - `CONTEXT.md` - Appended this session

**Key decisions:**
1. **Node.js pipeline (not GAS)**: GAS has 6-minute timeout and can't handle long-running video generation. Node.js runs on local/server with no timeout constraints
2. **fal.ai as media hub**: Consolidates Kling, ElevenLabs, and Lipsync under one API provider
3. **Google Sheets as DB**: Continues using Sheets for simplicity and compatibility with existing GAS analytics
4. **YouTube first for MVP**: Most stable API, fastest path to revenue
5. **Existing GAS analytics unchanged**: The 14 GAS files and 330 tests remain untouched

**Phase plan:**
- Phase 1 (2/10-12): MVP - 1 account, YouTube auto-posting
- Phase 2 (2/13-17): 12 YouTube + 12 Instagram accounts
- Phase 3 (2/18-28): All 50 accounts across 4 platforms

### 2026-02-10: Phase 0 - Content Generation Pipeline Implementation

**Why:** The n8n workflow analysis revealed 5 critical differences between the existing pipeline code and the actual production workflow. The pipeline needed to be rewritten to match the real n8n flow exactly.

**What was done:**

- **n8n workflow analysis**: Analyzed `ワークフロー.json` and `senario_template.xlsx` to extract the real 3-step process (Kling → TTS → Lipsync, no Creatify Aurora)
- **Created `pipeline/data/scenario.json`**: Extracted 3 sections (hook, body, cta) with scripts and motion reference video Drive IDs (`motionVideoDriveId`)
- **Fixed media module endpoints**:
  - `video-generator.js`: `image-to-video` → `motion-control` with `video_url`, `character_orientation` (NO `prompt` or `keep_original_sound` — causes 422)
  - `tts-generator.js`: `tts/v3` → `tts/eleven-v3` with voice name "Aria" instead of voice_id
  - `lipsync.js`: `v2` → `v2/pro` with `sync_mode: "bounce"`
- **Added fal.storage upload**: `uploadToFalStorage()` and `downloadFromDrive()` in `fal-client.js` — replaces Cloudinary with Drive → fal.storage → API pattern
- **Created ffmpeg concat utility**: `pipeline/media/concat.js` using concat demuxer for combining 3 section videos
- **Rewrote orchestrator**: New 3-section loop — downloads motion video from Drive per section → fal.storage → Kling → TTS → Lipsync, then ffmpeg concat + Drive upload (4 files) + sheet logging
- **Rewrote CLI**: `--character-folder <DRIVE_FOLDER_ID>` replaces `--account`
- **Deleted Cloudinary and Compositor modules**: Removed `compositor.js`, `cloudinary.js`, cloudinary config and dependency
- **Updated content_pipeline sheet schema**: New columns (character_folder_id, section_count, hook/body/cta_video_url, drive_folder_id)
- **Updated content-manager.js**: HEADERS array matches new sheet schema
- **Created pipeline test suite**: 21 tests covering modules, endpoints, ffmpeg, CLI, schema, edge cases
- **Updated Jest config**: Projects-based config for both GAS and pipeline test suites
- **E2E success**: First full pipeline run completed — CNT_202602_2916 (54MB final video, 3 sections)
  - Uploaded CHR_0001_v1.jpg to `Characters/Images/CHR_0001/`
  - Fixed `FAL_KEY || FAL_AI_KEY` fallback in config.js
  - Replaced dead Cloudinary URLs in scenario.json with Drive file IDs (motionVideoDriveId)
  - Removed invalid `prompt: ''` and `keep_original_sound: true` params from video-generator
  - Output: `Productions/2026-02-10/CNT_202602_2916/` with 4 MP4 files uploaded to Drive
  - content_pipeline sheet updated with status=completed and all Drive links
- **README.md rewritten**: Comprehensive specification document with pipeline flow, service descriptions, Drive folder structure, all Sheets schemas with column-level documentation, setup, usage, cost structure

**Key decisions:**
1. **Creatify Aurora removed**: n8n workflow doesn't use it — the 3-step process (Kling → TTS → Lipsync) is sufficient
2. **Cloudinary → fal.storage**: All persistent files in Drive, temporary URLs via fal.storage. No external image hosting needed
3. **3-section structure**: Each video consists of hook + body + cta, processed independently then concatenated
4. **ffmpeg for concatenation**: Simple `concat demuxer` with `-c copy` (no re-encoding) for fast joining
5. **Drive folder structure**: Productions/YYYY-MM-DD/CNT_XXXX/ with 4 files per content
6. **Motion videos from Drive**: scenario.json stores Drive file IDs (not URLs), orchestrator downloads + uploads to fal.storage per section

**Test results:** 357 tests passing (330 GAS + 27 pipeline)

### 2026-02-10: v4.0 - Production Rebuild

**Why:** Phase 0 proved the E2E pipeline works, but it relied on demo data and sequential processing. To hit the 36 videos/day target for 50 accounts by February, the system needed: (1) real data in all inventories, (2) parallel processing for speed, (3) proper inventory management modules, and (4) a production-grade tracking tab.

**What was done:**

- **Demo data → real data migration**:
  - Cleared all demo data from 4 inventory spreadsheets (Scenarios, Motions, Characters, Audio)
  - Populated inventories with real data from テンプレ.xlsx
  - Uploaded 3 motion videos to Drive (Hooks/Bodies/CTAs folders)

- **Accounts Inventory** (new spreadsheet):
  - 7 platform accounts configured
  - 12 Gmail credentials registered

- **Production tab** (new, 33 columns):
  - Replaces content_pipeline for new pipeline runs
  - Tracks video_id, all inventory IDs used, scripts, output URLs, processing time, cost, error details
  - content_pipeline tab preserved for backward compatibility (v3.1 records remain)

- **New pipeline modules**:
  - `pipeline/sheets/inventory-reader.js`: Reads from all 4 inventory spreadsheets, resolves component IDs to Drive file IDs and metadata
  - `pipeline/sheets/production-manager.js`: Creates/updates rows in the production tab, manages status transitions

- **Orchestrator parallelization** (`pipeline/orchestrator.js` rewrite):
  - 3 sections now processed in parallel via `Promise.all`
  - Within each section, Kling video generation and TTS run in parallel
  - Only Lipsync runs sequentially (requires both video and audio as input)
  - Processing time reduced from ~35min to ~12min per video

- **CLI update** (`scripts/run-pipeline.js`):
  - New flags: `--video-id <ID>`, `--limit <N>`
  - `--character-folder` deprecated (still works for backward compatibility)
  - Pipeline reads from inventory sheets instead of scenario.json

- **Deprecations**:
  - `pipeline/data/scenario.json`: No longer the primary data source; inventories are used instead
  - `--character-folder` CLI flag: Replaced by `--video-id`

- **Config updates** (`pipeline/config.js`):
  - Added `ACCOUNTS_SPREADSHEET_ID` for Accounts Inventory
  - Added `productionTab` configuration

**Key decisions:**
1. **Parallel Promise.all for 3 sections**: Each section is independent until lipsync, so process all 3 simultaneously
2. **Kling + TTS parallel within sections**: Video generation and audio generation don't depend on each other
3. **Production tab replaces content_pipeline for new runs**: Cleaner schema with 33 columns, keeps legacy data intact
4. **Inventory-driven pipeline**: scenario.json was static and limiting; reading from Sheets allows dynamic content selection
5. **Backward compatibility maintained**: `--character-folder` still works, content_pipeline tab preserved

**Files changed/created:**
- New: `pipeline/sheets/inventory-reader.js`, `pipeline/sheets/production-manager.js`
- Modified: `pipeline/orchestrator.js` (parallel rewrite), `pipeline/config.js` (accounts ID, productionTab), `scripts/run-pipeline.js` (new CLI flags)
- Deprecated: `pipeline/data/scenario.json`
- Docs: `STRATEGY.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `README.md`, `CONTEXT.md` all updated

**New Resource IDs:**
| Resource | ID |
|----------|-----|
| Accounts Inventory | `1CmT6C3qCW3md6lJ9Rvc2WNQkWa5zcvlq6Zp_enJHoUE` |

**Test results:** 357 tests passing (330 GAS + 27 pipeline)

**Bug fixes (same session):**
- `drive_file_id` column missing from Motions/Characters inventories → added to both
- `extractDriveFileId()` helper added to orchestrator.js: defensive fallback that extracts file ID from `drive_file_id` field or parses it from `file_link` URL patterns
- `fal-client.js`: enriched error messages now include fal.ai body details (e.g., balance exhausted reason)

**E2E real API result (v4.0 parallel pipeline — SUCCESS):**
- VID_202602_0001: 3 sections parallel, 1030s (17.2min) total
- Hook: 9.2MB, Body: 78.4MB, CTA: 17.3MB, Final: 104.9MB (100MB)
- Drive folder: `1IiMhXW7WfyCWADSj-aNF_-AWuzuv-pyy`
- Production tab auto-updated: pipeline_status=completed, all 4 video URLs, processing_time=1030s
- All API steps succeeded: character upload → 3× (motion upload + Kling + TTS parallel + Lipsync) → ffmpeg → Drive

**New documentation:**
- `OPERATIONS.md`: 667-line Japanese operations manual for human operators
  - Covers: inventory management, production workflow, CLI usage, troubleshooting, cost reference

### 2026-02-11: Documentation Audit & Reorganization

**Why:** ドキュメントが根幹レベルに散乱し、技術情報とビジネス情報が混在し、同じ情報が複数ファイルに重複していた。50→3,500アカウントのスケーリングに備え、チームメイトが迷わず参照できる体制を整備。

**What was done:**

- **ファイル構造の再編成**:
  - `STRATEGY.md` → `docs/STRATEGY.md`
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` → `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `OPERATIONS.md` → `docs/manuals/OPERATIONS.md`
  - `MANUAL.md` → `docs/manuals/GAS_MANUAL.md`
  - `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` → `docs/manuals/USER_GUIDE.md`
  - `docs/account-design-guide.md` → `docs/manuals/account-design-guide.md`
  - ルートには `README.md` と `CONTEXT.md` のみ残す

- **ドキュメントポリシー確立**:
  - **README.md**: 技術SSOT（スキーマ、コスト、Drive構造の唯一の定義場所）
  - **docs/STRATEGY.md**: ビジネス専用（KPI、収益、フェーズ、リスク、意思決定）— 技術的な仕様は含めない
  - **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md**: システム全体図、データフロー図、モジュール一覧
  - **docs/manuals/**: 人間オペレーター向けガイド
  - **重複禁止**: 各情報は1箇所のみに記載し、他はクロスリファレンス

- **重複コンテンツの除去**:
  - ARCHITECTURE.md: Sheetsスキーマ（110行）、コストセクション（20行）を削除 → README参照に変更
  - OPERATIONS.md: コスト参考（27行）、スプレッドシートスキーマ一覧（82行）を削除 → README参照に変更

- **KPI数値更新**（マスターシート.xlsxから）:
  - 5月: 520 → **1,480** アカウント
  - 6月: 700 → **3,500** アカウント

- **クロスリファレンス修正**: 全ファイルのマークダウンリンクを新パスに更新

- **account-design-guide.md**: チームメイト向けアカウント設計ガイド作成（ペルソナ設計、画像準備、シナリオ作成、インベントリ登録手順、テンプレート、FAQ）

- **セキュリティ監査**: git履歴・全ファイルをスキャンし、シークレット漏洩がないことを確認

**Commits:**
- `85ae670` Docs: audit cleanup — add docs index, fix stale refs, remove secrets
- `940ca10` Docs: add account design guide + tech stack table
- `6f4db09` Docs: reorganize structure, deduplicate content, update KPI numbers

### 2026-02-11: コスト分析 & システム設計ドキュメント

**Why:** コスト計算が10秒ベースで算出されていたが、実際のパイプライン設定は5秒/セクション。正確な単価に修正し、ステークホルダー向けの詳細コスト分析レポートを作成。また、50→3,500アカウントスケーリングに向けた全体システム設計と SNS API 調査が必要だった。

**What was done:**

- **コスト修正** ($3.72/本 → $2.34/本):
  - Kling: $0.70 → $0.35（5秒×$0.07/秒）
  - ElevenLabs: ~$0.04 → ~$0.01
  - Lipsync: $0.50 → $0.42（5秒/60×$5.00/分）
  - README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, OPERATIONS.md を全て更新

- **新規ドキュメント**:
  - `docs/cost-analysis/per-video-cost.md`: 1動画あたりのAPI費用内訳
  - `docs/cost-analysis/per-minute-cost.md`: 分単価比較（API vs GUI、他社サービス比較）
  - `docs/cost-analysis/full-system-design.md`: 全9フェーズのシステム設計書（614行）
    - 市場リサーチ → アカウント設計 → コンテンツ作成 → 投稿 → 計測 → 分析 → 改善のフルループ
    - 月別コスト試算（2月〜6月）、Pro/Std 2プラン比較
    - インフラ構成、並列化戦略、レート制限分析
  - `docs/research/SNS_API_RESEARCH.md`: 4プラットフォームのAPI調査レポート（615行）
    - YouTube / TikTok / Instagram / X の投稿API仕様、制限、認証方式

- **STRATEGY.md更新**: システム設計書・SNS研究へのクロスリファレンス追加

**Commits:**
- `9ef6f94` Docs: add cost analysis reports, fix API pricing across all docs
- `0e3f3eb` Docs: add full system design & SNS API research for 50→3,500 account scaling

### 2026-02-11: ローカル開発環境セットアップ & ドキュメント修正

**Why:** Tailscale VPNの接続不安定（東京リレー障害、全リージョン~2sレイテンシ）により、VM上での開発作業が困難に。GitHubからローカルにクローンして作業環境を構築。

**What was done:**

- **ローカル環境構築**:
  - `gh repo clone Ceed-dev/ai-influencer` で ~/Programming/ai-influencer にクローン
  - SCP経由でVMから秘密ファイル3点を取得: `.env`, `.gsheets_token.json`, `video_analytics_hub_claude_code_oauth.json`
  - `npm install` 実行（313パッケージ）
  - Google Sheets API接続確認（productionタブ読取OK）
  - Google Drive API接続確認
  - 全357テストパス（330 GAS + 27 pipeline）

- **STRATEGY.md修正**:
  - 投稿頻度の記述を修正: 「7本/週」→「1日1本/アカウント（日次総投稿数 = 稼働アカウント数）」
  - 分析・改善フェーズのステータスを🟢自動 → 🔴実装途中に修正（基盤実装済みだが本番運用未開始）
  - 市場リサーチ用シート準備タスクを直近の優先事項に追加（2/14使用開始、Badhan作成→駿冴FB）

**Key notes:**
- VMのrefresh_tokenがローカルでもそのまま有効（ブラウザOAuth認証不要）
- client.jsの自動トークンリフレッシュ機構により、期限切れトークンも自動更新
- Tailscale Exit Nodeは未設定のため、一般インターネットはVPN経由せず直接アクセス

### 2026-02-12: パイプライン仕様確認 & 未実装機能の洗い出し

**Why:** 36動画/日の量産運用に向けて、現状のパイプラインが実際にそのスループットを達成できるかの確認。

**確認結果 — 現状のギャップ:**

1. **パイプラインは「レシピ実行器」**: productionシートに`edit_status=ready`の行がある場合のみ動画を生成する。何を作るか自体は決めない。つまり毎日36本作るには、毎日36行のレシピ（account_id, scenario_id, motion_id, character_id, audio_id, scripts）をproductionシートに書き込む必要がある。この自動化は未実装。

2. **プール制御（未実装）**: 動画プールが一定数（例:100本）溜まったら停止、消費されたら再開する仕組みがない。現状は手動で`--limit N`を叩く運用。

3. **動画並列生成（未実装）**: 現状は1本ずつ順次処理（各本内の3セクションは並列）。36本順次 = ~7.2時間。複数本の同時生成ロジックは未実装。

4. **投稿オペレーション手順書（未作成）**: 「毎日どのシートを見て、どこからDLして、投稿後にどこを更新するか」の手順書がない。

**fal.aiクレジット試算:**
- 36本/日 × $2.31/本 = $83.16/日
- ストレステスト1回: ~$100（リトライ余裕含む）
- $1,000購入で40並行タスクアンロック（本番運用向け）

### 2026-02-12: TTS Migration: ElevenLabs → Fish Audio

- Migrated TTS from ElevenLabs (fal.ai proxy) to Fish Audio (Hanabi AI Inc., 直接REST API — fal.ai とは完全に別サービス)
- Code changes: tts-generator.js (full rewrite), config.js (fishAudio section), orchestrator.js (referenceId param), inventory-reader.js (voice_id required validation)
- Removed deprecated `runPipeline` function and legacy CLI options (`--character-folder`)
- voice_id (Fish Audio reference_id) を必須化: 空欄だとパイプラインがエラー停止
- FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY 未設定時に明確なエラーメッセージを追加
- Cost reduction: ~90% on TTS ($0.01→$0.001 per section), per-video total $2.34→$2.31 (Pro)
- Fish Audio returns binary MP3 → uploaded to fal.storage for lipsync compatibility
- ドキュメント全体で fal.ai と Fish Audio を明確に分離（別サービスであることを明記）
- voice_models タブを Audio Inventory に作成（EN 10 + JA 10 = 20モデル）
- Production sheet VID_202602_0001 に voice_id 設定: `802e3bc2b27e49c2995d23ef70e6ac89` (Energetic Male)
- 358 tests passing (330 GAS + 28 pipeline)

## Technical Notes

### Platform CSV Column Variations

YouTube may change column names between exports. Known variations:
- "Views" / "View count" / "視聴回数"
- "Watch time (hours)" / "総再生時間（時間）"

TikTok variations:
- "Video views" / "Views"
- "Average watch time" / "Avg. watch time"

Instagram variations:
- "Plays" / "Views"
- "Reach" / "Accounts reached"

### GAS Limitations to Remember
- 6-minute execution timeout
- 20MB response size limit
- 100 triggers per user limit
- Properties Service: 500KB total, 9KB per property

### OpenAI Integration Notes
- Use TSV output format for structured responses (more reliable parsing than JSON)
- Batch multiple videos per request to reduce API calls
- Implement exponential backoff for rate limiting
- v2.0: Include component context for better recommendations

### v2.0 Component Score System
- Each analyzed video's overall_score contributes to its components' avg_performance_score
- Scores normalized 0-100 across platforms
- Top-performing components surfaced in AI recommendation prompts
- Score updates cascade: video analyzed -> master updated -> all linked components updated

### 2026-02-12: Pipeline GUI Execution — Sheet Button → Auto Generation

**What was done:**
- Added Pipeline submenu to Google Sheets UI (Video Analytics v2 > Pipeline)
- Created `gas/PipelineUI.gs` with queue/validate/status/stop handlers
- Added `getQueuedRows()` to `production-manager.js` (watcher-specific filter)
- Created `scripts/watch-pipeline.js` polling daemon (30s interval, PM2-managed)
- Created `ecosystem.config.js` for PM2 process management
- Added 5 pipeline tests (tests 28-32) and 13 GAS PipelineUI tests
- Updated OPERATIONS.md with GUI workflow as primary, CLI as "advanced"
- Updated ARCHITECTURE.md with watcher architecture diagram

**Key decisions:**
1. **GAS for UI only, Node.js for processing**: GAS handles menu/validation/status. All API calls run on VM.
2. **Polling over webhooks**: 30s polling is simpler and more reliable than GAS triggers or webhooks.
3. **queued vs queued_dry**: Two statuses allow dry-run from the same GUI workflow.
4. **Concurrent job processing**: Watcher processes up to MAX_CONCURRENT=5 videos simultaneously (updated 2026-02-14, was 1 job per poll).
5. **PM2 for process management**: Auto-restart, systemd integration, log management.

**New files:**
- `gas/PipelineUI.gs` — GAS Pipeline menu handlers
- `scripts/watch-pipeline.js` — Polling watcher daemon
- `ecosystem.config.js` — PM2 configuration
- `gas/tests/PipelineUI.test.js` — 13 GAS UI handler tests

**Test count: 376** (343 GAS / 10 suites + 33 pipeline / 1 suite)

### 2026-02-13: KPI達成可能性分析レポート作成

**Why:** 現行のフロー・仕様を前提に、6月までのKPI（50→3,500アカウント）がどの程度達成可能かを定量的に評価する必要があった。ステークホルダーへの現実的な見通しの共有と、優先施策の明確化が目的。

**What was done:**

- **`docs/KPI-FEASIBILITY-ANALYSIS.md`** 新規作成（504行、日本語）
  - プロジェクト全体（パイプラインコード、GASコード、全ドキュメント、テスト・設定）を網羅的に調査した上で分析
  - 8セクション構成: エグゼクティブサマリー / KPI目標整理 / 現状能力分析 / 月別達成可能性 / ボトルネック分析 / 収益予測の現実性 / 必要アクション / 結論

**分析結果サマリー:**

| 月 | KPI目標 | 現実的予測 | 達成率 | 主要制約 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2月 | 50 | 15〜30 | 30〜60% | fal.aiクレジット未購入、アカウント設計遅延 |
| 3月 | 160 | 30〜65 | 19〜41% | マルチワーカー未実装、2月の遅延波及 |
| 4月 | 340 | 50〜120 | 15〜35% | 投稿自動化が分岐点 |
| 5月 | 1,480 | 80〜250 | 5〜17% | アーキテクチャ世代交代の成否 |
| 6月 | 3,500 | 100〜400 | 3〜11% | 全自動化・大規模インフラ未完成 |

**特定した6つのボトルネック（影響度順）:**
1. 投稿の手動運用（致命的）— 4月340件/日が物理的上限
2. シングルワーカー構成（高）— 3月126本/日で既にキャパ超過
3. アカウント立ち上げの手動プロセス（高）— 5月に52件/日の新規が必要
4. インベントリ不足（中〜高）— シナリオ3本・モーション3本のみ
5. fal.ai同時タスク制限（中）— 5月以降エンタープライズ必須
6. Google Sheetsのスケーラビリティ（中）— 15ワーカー同時で競合リスク

**収益予測の検証:**
- STRATEGY.mdの収益予測（6月: ¥3.78億/月）は、全アカウントが一定フォロワー基盤を持つ前提
- 新規アカウントはフォロワーゼロからスタート、各プラットフォームの収益化条件達成に3〜12ヶ月要する
- 現実的な6月収益: ¥50万〜500万（計画比1〜1.3%）

**根本原因:** KPIが指数関数的成長（特に5月+335%）を要求するのに対し、システム開発・組織拡大は線形的にしか進められないギャップ

### 2026-02-13: KPI達成可能性分析 v2 — AI駆動シナリオ比較レポート

**Why:** v1レポートでは現行仕様ベースで6月KPI達成率3〜11%と評価。しかし「全自動化が完成した場合」「AIエージェントチームを基盤にした場合」という2つの追加シナリオの分析が必要だった。市場側の不確実性は許容すべきものとして扱い、システム側で改善可能な範囲に焦点を当てる。

**What was done:**

- **`docs/KPI-FEASIBILITY-ANALYSIS-v2-AI-DRIVEN.md`** 新規作成（約410行、日本語）
  - 3シナリオ比較: 現行(v1) / コード全自動化(A) / AIエージェントチーム(B)
  - Claude Code Agent Team の技術調査（実験的機能、コンテキスト制約、コスト構造）
  - エージェントチーム構成案（5班、20〜50エージェント）のアーキテクチャ図
  - 許容すべき不確実性の整理（コンテンツ品質、フォロワー獲得速度、規約リスク、学習効果）

- **`docs/KPI-FEASIBILITY-ANALYSIS.md`** 修正
  - ページ上部のblockquote書式を修正（項目間に空行挿入で改行表示に対応）

**3シナリオ比較結果:**

| シナリオ | 6月KPI達成率 | フル稼働までの期間 | 核心的な違い |
|---|---|---|---|
| 現行（v1） | 3〜11% | 未定 | 手動運用の限界 |
| A: コード全自動化 | 20〜51% | 3〜4ヶ月 | 開発リードタイムがボトルネック |
| B: AIエージェントチーム | 35〜71% | 即日〜数日 | 開発リードタイムゼロ |

**シナリオBの優位性:**
- コード開発の待ち時間がない（即日稼働）
- エージェント追加 = 処理能力追加（インフラ構築不要）
- 自律的エラー復旧、24時間稼働
- SNSアカウントの複利的成長（早期投稿開始が6月成果に指数関数的に寄与）

**残存する共通制約:**
- fal.ai処理時間（1動画12分は物理的制約）
- プラットフォームアカウント登録（CAPTCHA等は人手が必要）
- コンテンツ品質の市場適合（実データで検証するしかない）

### 2026-02-13: アルゴリズムとコンテンツ量の関係性分析

**Why:** KPI達成可能性分析（v1/v2）で「許容すべき不確実性」としていた「コンテンツ数に比例してアルゴリズムの的中率が上がる」という前提の検証が必要。この前提が正しくない場合、KPI戦略全体の見直しが必要になる。

**What was done:**

- **`docs/ALGORITHM-CONTENT-VOLUME-ANALYSIS.md`** 新規作成（約600行、日本語）
  - 4プラットフォーム（YouTube Shorts / TikTok / Instagram Reels / X）の最新アルゴリズムを網羅的に調査
  - Buffer社1,140万投稿分析、Metricool社Reels年次比較、NexLev 9,414チャンネル分析等のデータソースを使用
  - 9セクション構成: エグゼクティブサマリー / 前提検証 / プラットフォーム別分析 / AI生成コンテンツのハンディキャップ / 成長曲線の数学モデル / ペナルティリスク / KPI前提への影響 / 推奨戦略 / 結論

**主要な発見:**

1. **「量 ∝ 的中率」は誤り** — 各コンテンツは独立に評価される。量は「宝くじの枚数」を増やすだけで、1枚あたりの当選確率は変わらない
2. **関係は対数的（logarithmic）** — TikTok 1,140万件分析: 投稿頻度を11倍にしても中央値視聴数は横ばい（489→459）
3. **品質が量を圧倒** — 完視聴率60%で1本/日 > 完視聴率20%で3本/日。全プラットフォームで70%以上の完視聴率がバイラルトリガー
4. **AI生成コンテンツの成功率: 0.2〜0.3%** — エンゲージメント率は人間の半分以下（1.8〜2.5% vs 4.1%）
5. **STRATEGY.mdのインプレッション想定は10〜100倍の過大評価** — 新規アカウント初月のTikTok中央値は489（想定15,000）

**KPI戦略への提言:** 「3,500アカウントの量産」→「少数の高品質アカウント育成 → 成功パターンの横展開」へのシフトを推奨

### 2026-02-13: Pipeline GUI E2E検証 & ドキュメント整合性修正

**Why:** 前回セッション（2026-02-12）で実装したPipeline GUI実行機能の実機検証と、ドキュメントの整合性確認・修正。

**E2Eテスト結果:**
- PM2ウォッチャー: 17時間稼働中、リスタート0回、エラーログ空
- Dry Run テスト: productionタブにテスト行を追加 → `queued_dry` 設定 → ウォッチャーが30秒以内に検出 → 全5ステップ完了（1秒）→ `dry_run_complete` に自動更新
- 発見した問題: motionsインベントリに `MOT_0001` のみ登録。`MOT_0002`/`MOT_0003` は存在せず、Row 2の既存データは再実行不可。これはデータ（人間のインベントリ登録）の問題であり、コードのバグではない。

**ドキュメント修正:**
- `OPERATIONS.md`: 最終更新日修正（2026-02-10→2026-02-13）、概要のパイプライン実行方法をGUI反映、motion IDの例をMOT_0001に統一（存在しないIDの例示を修正）
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: 最終更新日修正（2026-02-10→2026-02-13）
- `CONTEXT.md`: Files in Repositoryセクションに `PipelineUI.gs`, `watch-pipeline.js`, `ecosystem.config.js` 追加。テスト数を最新値に更新（GAS 343/10 suites, Pipeline 33/1 suite）

### 2026-02-13: script_language カラム追加 — EN/JP 動的スクリプト選択

**Why:** パイプラインが常に `script_en` を使用していたため、日本語アカウント（target_region=JP）でも英語音声しか生成できなかった。`script_language` カラムを追加し、production タブから動的に EN/JP を切り替えられるようにする。

**What was done:**

- **production タブ拡張** (32カラム → 33カラム):
  - 新カラム `script_language` を `voice_id` の後（#13）に挿入
  - 値: `en` または `jp`（パイプラインコードでは空の場合 `en` にフォールバック）
  - GAS バリデーションでは必須フィールドとして扱う（`PRODUCTION_REQUIRED_FIELDS` に追加）
  - 以降の全カラム番号が +1 シフト（`pipeline_status` が #13 → #14 等）

- **パイプラインコード変更**:
  - `production-manager.js`: HEADERS に `script_language` 追加（33カラム）
  - `inventory-reader.js`: `resolveProductionRow()` で `script_language` を読み取り、`en`/`jp` のバリデーション、`scriptLanguage` フィールドとして返却
  - `orchestrator.js`: ハードコードされた `script_en` → 動的な `script_${scriptLanguage}` に変更。`section.scenario[scriptKey]` でスクリプト取得

- **GAS 変更**:
  - `Config.gs`: `PRODUCTION_REQUIRED_FIELDS` に `script_language` 追加（9フィールド）

- **テスト追加** (33 → 36 pipeline tests):
  - Test: production-manager HEADERS が 33 カラムであること
  - Test: orchestrator が動的 `scriptKey` パターンを使用すること
  - Test: inventory-reader が `script_language` を `en`/`jp` でバリデーションすること

- **ドキュメント更新**:
  - README.md: production タブスキーマに script_language 追加、カラム番号再採番、32→33
  - ARCHITECTURE.md: 32→33カラム、TTS説明に script_language 選択を追記
  - OPERATIONS.md: シナリオ説明・制作行テーブルに script_language 追加
  - account-design-guide.md: 地域×言語テーブル・production行テーブルに script_language 追加
  - STRATEGY.md, KPI-FEASIBILITY-ANALYSIS.md: 32→33カラム

**Files changed:**

**Test results:** 379 tests passing (343 GAS / 10 suites + 36 pipeline / 1 suite)

### 2026-02-13: インベントリキャッシュ修正 — 毎ポーリング最新取得

**Why:** watch-pipeline.js がインベントリデータをプロセス起動時に1回だけキャッシュし、以降は再読み込みしなかった。そのため、インベントリシートに新しいコンポーネント（モーション、シナリオ、キャラクター）を追加しても、watcher を再起動しない限り反映されなかった。

**What was done:**

- `scripts/watch-pipeline.js`: `clearCache` を import に追加、`pollOnce()` の先頭で毎回 `clearCache()` を呼び出し
- これにより毎ポーリング（30秒ごと）に motions/scenarios/characters の3インベントリキャッシュがクリアされ、`resolveProductionRow()` 実行時に各インベントリシートから最新データを取得

**影響:**
- 今後はインベントリシートにコンポーネントを追加した際、watcher 再起動不要で自動的に反映される
- Google Sheets API の呼び出し回数は増加するが、ポーリング間隔（30秒）で十分なレート内

**Commit:** `be2eb62`

### 2026-02-13: Kling タイムアウト延長 & リトライ改善 + Characters Inventory 画像データ登録

**Why:** VID_202602_0002 の本番パイプライン実行時に body セクションの Kling 動画生成（`fal-ai/kling-video/v2.6/standard/motion-control`）が fal.ai のキュー混雑により 10分のデフォルトタイムアウトで失敗。また Characters Inventory の `file_link`/`drive_file_id` が未登録でパイプラインがキャラクター画像を取得できなかった。

**What was done:**

- **Kling タイムアウト延長** (`pipeline/media/video-generator.js`):
  - `submitAndWait` に `timeout: 1800000`（30分）を明示指定（デフォルト10分では不足）

- **タイムアウトをリトライ対象に追加** (`pipeline/media/fal-client.js`):
  - `err.message.includes('timed out')` をリトライ条件に追加
  - タイムアウト発生時も最大3回リトライするように改善

- **Characters Inventory 画像データ登録**:
  - Drive `Characters/Images/` フォルダ内の CHR_0001〜CHR_0012 サブフォルダから画像ファイルを特定
  - E列（`file_link`）: 12行に Google Drive URL を記入
  - K列（`drive_file_id`）: 12行に生のファイルIDを記入
  - パイプラインは `drive_file_id` を優先使用、なければ `file_link` からIDを正規表現で抽出（`orchestrator.js` L68-74）

**Commits:** `be2eb62` (cache fix), `56c92c8` (CONTEXT.md), `6ec4189` (timeout + retry)

### Session: 2026-02-13 — 黒フレーム修正（ffmpeg concat 再エンコード + 検証）

**問題**: 結合動画の先頭 ~0.1秒に黒フレームが発生。
**根本原因**: ffmpeg `-c copy` concat demuxer がストリームタイムスタンプをリマップせず、`start_time=0.023s` のオフセットが残る。プレーヤーは 0s〜0.023s の間を黒で表示する。

**修正内容**:
- **`pipeline/media/concat.js`**: concat demuxer + `-c copy` → filter_complex + H.264 再エンコード方式に変更
  - `[0:v][0:a][1:v][1:a]...concat=n=N:v=1:a=1` フィルタで動的にクリップ数対応
  - `-c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 18 -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -b:a 192k -movflags +faststart`
  - タイムアウト 60s → 180s（再エンコードのため）
  - 新規エクスポート: `detectBlackFrames(buffer)` — blackdetect フィルタで黒フレーム検出
  - 新規エクスポート: `trimBlackStart(buffer, duration)` — 先頭の黒フレームをトリム
- **`pipeline/orchestrator.js`**: Step 3 に黒フレーム検証ステップ追加
  - `validating_video` フェーズ: blackdetect → 先頭黒フレーム自動トリム → 再検証 → Drive保存
  - 中間の黒フレームはWARNINGログ（パイプラインは停止しない）
- **`tests/pipeline.test.js`**: 38テスト（+3新規）
  - Test 9: `detectBlackFrames`, `trimBlackStart` エクスポート確認
  - Test 11b: blackdetect が黒フレームを検出するテスト
  - Test 11c: filter_complex 再エンコード方式の確認
  - Test 14: orchestrator に `detectBlackFrames`, `trimBlackStart` 参照確認
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`**: Step 4 説明更新、mermaid図に blackdetect 検証ステップ追加
- **既存動画修正**: VID_202602_0001〜0003 を `setpts=PTS-STARTPTS` で再エンコード（start_time 0.023s → 0.000s）、Drive 上でファイルID保持のまま差し替え

### Session: 2026-02-13 — 画像サイズ超過 & voice_id バリデーション修正

**問題**:
- Row 6 (VID_202602_0005, CHR_0007): `Unprocessable Entity: [object Object]` — 画像 3840x6832 が Kling の 3850x3850 上限を超過
- Row 9 (VID_202602_0008, CHR_0010): `Fish Audio TTS failed (400): Reference not found` — voice_id `4cf4237e99a4d78999fe05acad79a60` が31文字（正しくは32文字hex）

**修正内容**:
- **`pipeline/orchestrator.js`**: `resizeImageIfNeeded()` 関数追加。キャラクター画像が 3850px を超える場合、ffmpeg で自動リサイズしてからfal.storageにアップロード
- **`pipeline/media/fal-client.js`**: エラーメッセージの enrichment 修正。`err.body.detail` が配列の場合 `JSON.stringify` で文字列化（`[object Object]` 表示バグ修正）
- **`pipeline/sheets/inventory-reader.js`**: voice_id バリデーション強化。32文字hex 正規表現チェック追加（不正な voice_id を早期検出してエラーメッセージ改善）

**Note**: Row 9 の voice_id は production シート側のデータ問題（31文字）。正しい32文字hex IDに修正が必要。

- **`scripts/watch-pipeline.js`**: `resolveProductionRow` エラー時もシートを `error` に更新するよう修正。以前は `runSingleJob` の前にエラーが発生すると `queued` のまま無限ループしていた。
- **`pipeline/orchestrator.js`**: `trimVideoIfNeeded()` 関数追加。モーション参照動画が30秒を超える場合、ffmpeg で先頭30秒に自動トリムしてからfal.storageにアップロード（Kling motion-control の上限: 30s）。
  - Row 8 (MOT_0008: 209s) と Row 11 (MOT_0008: 209s) のエラーを解決。
  - Motions Inventory 全体で body モーション12本中9本が30秒超（最大209s）。全てパイプライン側で自動対応。

### Session: 2026-02-14 — パイプライン並列化 + 短尺モーション自動ループ

**問題**:
1. watcher が1ジョブずつ逐次処理で、1動画20分×多数行のデッドラインに間に合わない
2. モーション動画が3秒未満（Kling最小3s）のものが7行エラー（Row 26-31, 33）

**修正内容**:
- **`scripts/watch-pipeline.js`**: 逐次処理 → 最大5ジョブ同時並列処理
  - `processing` boolean → `activeJobs` Map（video_id → Promise）で複数ジョブを追跡
  - `getQueuedRows(1)` → `getQueuedRows(MAX_CONCURRENT - activeJobs.size)` で空きスロット分だけ取得
  - `pollOnce()`: 空きスロットがあるときのみポーリング、既に処理中の video_id はスキップ
  - グレースフルシャットダウン: `Promise.allSettled` で全アクティブジョブの完了を待機
- **`ecosystem.config.js`**: `MAX_CONCURRENT: 5` を env に追加
- **`pipeline/orchestrator.js`**: `trimVideoIfNeeded(buffer, max, min=3)` を拡張
  - 3秒未満: ffmpeg `-stream_loop` でループ再生 → `-t 3` で3秒に切り詰め（H.264再エンコード）
  - 30秒超: 従来通り `-c copy` でトリム
  - JSDoc更新: "3-30s" 範囲対応を明記
- **`tests/pipeline.test.js`**: watcher テストに `MAX_CONCURRENT`/`activeJobs` 確認追加、ecosystem テストに `MAX_CONCURRENT=5` 追加

**並列処理の制約要因**:
- fal.ai: アカウント単位の同時処理数制限（5並列で30同時リクエスト）
- Fish Audio TTS: Plus プランのレート制限
- Google Sheets API: 60 write/min/user（5並列で~25回/min → 安全圏）
- メモリ: 5並列で~1GB（VM スペック内）
- **推奨上限: 5**（8以上はSheets APIクォータ超えリスク）

**Commit:** `63aab64`

### Session: 2026-02-14 — ffmpeg concat タイムアウト修正

**問題**: 5ジョブ同時並列処理時、ffmpeg concat（H.264再エンコード）が複数同時実行されるとCPU競合でタイムアウト（180秒）を超過。8本がconcatエラーで失敗（VID_202602_0010, 0021, 0022, 0031, 0032, 0034, 0035, 0036）。

**根本原因**: `preset: medium` は 0.11x リアルタイム速度（3fps）。20秒の動画に約180秒かかり、5ジョブ同時CPU競合で180秒タイムアウトを超過。

**修正内容**:
- **`pipeline/media/concat.js`**:
  - `preset: medium` → `preset: fast` — エンコード速度2-3倍向上、短尺動画では品質差なし
  - `timeout: 180000` → `timeout: 600000` — 安全マージン確保（180秒→600秒）

**処理結果（このセッション全体）**:
- 成功（10本）: VID_202602_0007, 0019, 0023, 0024, 0025, 0026, 0027, 0028, 0029, 0030
- concat エラー（8本、修正前に発生）: VID_202602_0010, 0021, 0022, 0031, 0032, 0034, 0035, 0036
  - これらは修正後のコードで再キューすれば処理可能

**Test results:** 38 pipeline tests passing

### Session: 2026-02-14〜15 — X投稿36本生成 + Drive整理 + スプレッドシート再構成

**Why:** Phase 2 の X アカウント運用に向けて、12キャラクター × 3日分（2/14, 2/15, 2/16）= 36本の X 投稿コンテンツを一括生成する必要があった。

**What was done:**

- **X投稿36本生成（Agent Team方式）**:
  - 3つのバッチエージェント（batch-a, batch-b, batch-c）で12キャラを4キャラずつ並列処理
  - 各エージェント: キャラ設定読み込み → 競合調査（WebSearch）→ 投稿の型分析 → トレンド収集 → 投稿生成
  - 1キャラ3投稿 × 12キャラ = 36投稿を完成
  - 品質チェック: フレームワーク（AIDA/PAS/BAB/PASONA）、フック型、感情トリガー、心理テクニックの多様性を確認
  - JP 9キャラ + EN 3キャラ（美女ホスト、自信MAXセレブ、AI_Toolテックミューズ）

- **管理スプレッドシート作成** (ID: `1pWqXHckZWoTuTQ1r1hqnmr57ioo5aQ8ZTSRntzMHJ08`):
  - タイトル: "X投稿管理 2026年2月14-16日 (36投稿)"
  - 最終構成（2タブ）:
    - **投稿タスク**: オペレーター向けメインタブ（36行、時系列ソート、チェックボックス付き）
    - **全投稿データ**: 全18列のリファレンスタブ
  - 投稿タスク列: 投稿済み(checkbox) / 投稿予定日 / 推奨投稿時間 / キャラ名 / アカウント(空欄) / 投稿本文 / ハッシュタグ / CTA / 投稿ID
  - 日付ごと色分け: 2/14=水色、2/15=薄緑、2/16=薄黄色
  - ヘッダー固定、投稿本文テキスト折り返し
  - 参考にしたフォーマット: 動画投稿スケジュール (ID: `1f9cB4EZU2eDsa-ibjyht6FQZkPqiIPgfGgPFYxl6AM4`)

- **Driveフォルダ整理**:
  - 新フォルダ `03_X投稿_全12キャラ_2026年2月14-16日` を作成 (ID: `1tR4IJU3_ROOkNARNh5Jf1MELa14LJTBF`)
  - 親フォルダ: キャラクター情報 (ID: `1SWJV-3nZfotIJuPna6tf1ERhLrqUB8lq`)
  - アップロードしたファイル（9点）:
    - X投稿管理スプレッドシート（移動）
    - all_posts.json (54KB), all_posts.csv (39KB)
    - research_batch-a/b/c.md（調査結果 × 3）
    - quality_review_batch-a/b/c.md（品質チェック × 3）
  - ローカル `tmp/x-posts-36/` ディレクトリは確認後に削除済み

- **スプレッドシート再構成**（オペレーター向け最適化）:
  - 削除したタブ: 投稿スケジュール、2月14日、2月15日、2月16日（冗長なため）
  - 新タブ「投稿タスク」を作成・先頭に配置
  - 36投稿を時系列ソート（日付→投稿時間順）で配置
  - チェックボックス（列A）でワンクリック完了記録
  - MCP `create_drive_file` がフォルダ作成非対応のため、Python + Drive API 直接呼び出しで対応

**Key decisions:**
1. **Agent Team方式**: 12キャラを3バッチに分割して並列生成（速度 + コンテキスト管理）
2. **キャラ設定はDriveのmdファイル**: `01_キャラクター設定/` 配下の9ファイルを直接参照
3. **スプレッドシートは2タブ構成**: オペレーター向け（投稿タスク）+ アーカイブ（全投稿データ）
4. **コンテンツ内容は編集不可**: 再構成は見た目のみ、投稿本文・CTA・ハッシュタグはそのまま維持

**New Resource IDs:**
| Resource | ID |

### Session: 2026-02-15 — 動画投稿スケジュールシート作成

**Why:** 36本の生成済み動画を3日間（2/15, 2/16, 2/17）で12アカウント × 3プラットフォーム（YouTube, TikTok, Instagram）に投稿する必要がある。productionシートはIDベースで投稿担当者には分かりづらいため、必要情報を1シートにまとめた投稿スケジュールを作成。

**What was done:**

- **投稿スケジュールシート作成** (`投稿スケジュール_202602`):
  - Drive AI-Influencer フォルダ直下に新規スプレッドシート作成
  - ID: `1f9cB4EZU2eDsa-ibjyht6FQZkPqiIPgfGgPFYxl6AM4`

- **データ集約（4ソースから読み取り専用で取得）**:
  - **productionシート** (`1fI1s_...SpPg`): account_id, title, final_video_url
  - **キャラクターインベントリ** (`1-m4f5...FHCHA`): character_id → character_name 解決
  - **アカウントインベントリ** (`1CmT6...oUE`): persona_name, platform, email, password（accounts tab）+ gmail_password, two_factor_recovery（gmail_credentials tab）
  - **管理ボード** (`1miRw...zC84`): ACC_0010〜ACC_0034 の不足情報（persona, email, IG password）を補完 + Gメールログイン情報タブからgmail_password/2FA

- **アカウントマッピング（管理ボード → account_id）**:
  - ACC_0001 → 0xviolet.xyz (TikTok)
  - ACC_0004 → 0xvioletxyz (Instagram)
  - ACC_0007 → tramdestiny_2000 (Instagram)
  - ACC_0010〜ACC_0034 → 管理ボード rows 10-18（Instagram、順序ベースのマッピング）

- **シート構成変更の経緯**:
  1. production B,C,E,S列をコピー → character_id → character_name に置換・ID列削除
  2. accounts inventory からアカウント情報4列追加（persona, platform, email, password）
  3. gmail_password, two_factor_recovery 2列追加（email/password の横に配置）
  4. チェックボックス列（投稿済み）をA列に追加
  5. account_id 昇順ソート（ACC_0001〜ACC_0034）
  6. 各動画行の下に空2行追加 → 3プラットフォーム展開（TikTok/Instagram/YouTube）
  7. 全108行にチェックボックスData Validation適用

- **最終シート構成**（108行 = 36動画 × 3プラットフォーム、11列）:

| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 投稿済み☐ | account_id | persona_name | platform | email | password | gmail_password | two_factor_recovery | title | character_name | final_video_url |

**残課題（未対応）:**
1. **TikTok/YouTubeのパスワードが不正確**: 現在IGパスワードをコピーしているが、管理ボードにはプラットフォーム別パスワードが存在（rows 18-27がTikTok用）
2. **8本の動画にfinal_video_urlなし**: VID_0010, 0025, 0026, 0027, 0028, 0029, 0031, 0032（lipsyncエラー等）→ 24行が動画なし
3. **投稿日の列なし**: 36本を3日間にどう割り当てるか未指定
4. **YouTubeアカウント情報なし**: 管理ボードにYouTubeの行が存在しない
5. **ACC_0001のTikTokパスワード空**: 管理ボード・インベントリどちらにも未登録

**Key decisions:**
1. **元シート変更禁止**: production, accounts inventory, character inventory, 管理ボード全て読み取り専用
2. **1動画3行展開**: 各動画を3プラットフォーム（TikTok/Instagram/YouTube）分に展開し、投稿担当者が1行ずつチェックできる構成
3. **ACC_0010〜ACC_0034のマッピング**: 管理ボードの順序ベースで割り当て（platformがInstagramで一致、9アカウント=9行）

**New Resource IDs:**

### Session: 2026-02-16 — X投稿自動化 + YouTube Shorts自動投稿 実装

**Why:** 36本のX投稿コンテンツ生成は完了していたが、投稿自体は手動オペレーション。4プラットフォーム（X, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram）の投稿自動化が必要。このセッションではX投稿とYouTube Shorts投稿の2プラットフォームを実装。

**アーキテクチャ（X・YouTube共通パターン）:**
```
[投稿管理 Spreadsheet]  →  [task-manager.js]  →  [watch-*.js (PM2)]  →  [adapter.js]  →  Platform API
                                                        ↑
                                                [credential-manager.js]
                                                (per-account OAuth tokens)

  - Accounts Inventoryから `platform === 'X'` のアカウント一覧 → 選択 → PIN認可 → token保存
- `scripts/watch-posting.js`: PM2投稿デーモン（60秒ポーリング、最大3件/poll）
  - Rate limit対応（429→待機、401/403→markError）

**YouTube Shorts自動投稿（新規実装）:**
- `pipeline/posting/yt-credential-manager.js`: per-account OAuth 2.0 refresh token管理（`.yt-credentials.json`）
- `pipeline/sheets/yt-posting-task-manager.js`: YT投稿管理スプレッドシート読み書き（12列 A-L）
  - `YT_CHARACTER_NAME_MAP`: 12キャラ → ACC_0003〜ACC_0036（YouTube用アカウント）
  - 時間窓関数はX用 `posting-task-manager.js` からインポート（コード再利用）
  - `getReadyPosts()`: 未投稿 + 日付条件 + 時間窓 + drive_file_id必須
- `pipeline/posting/adapters/youtube.js`: マルチアカウント対応 + Drive→tmp→upload
  - `uploadShort(accountId, { driveFileId, title, description, tags })`: Drive DL → tmpファイル → YouTube upload → cleanup
  - `downloadVideoToTemp(driveFileId)`: Drive API streaming DL → os.tmpdir
  - `upload()`: 後方互換（既存poster.js用、単一config.youtube.refreshToken使用）
- `scripts/yt-oauth-setup.js`: OAuth 2.0認可CLI（localhost:3000 callback + `--manual` mode）
  - `youtube.channels.list({ mine: true })` でchannelId/channelTitle取得
- `scripts/watch-yt-posting.js`: PM2投稿デーモン（120秒ポーリング、最大2件/poll）
  - **日次quotaカウンタ**: YT_DAILY_LIMIT=6（10,000 units / 1,600 per upload）
  - quotaExceeded → 当日停止、日付変更でリセット

**Config・インフラ変更:**
- `pipeline/config.js`: youtube セクション拡張（credentialsPath, postingSpreadsheetId, postingTab）、x セクション追加（credentialsPath, postingSpreadsheetId, postingTab）
- `ecosystem.config.js`: 3つのPM2アプリ（pipeline-watcher, posting-scheduler, yt-posting-scheduler）
- `.gitignore`: `.x-credentials.json`, `.yt-credentials.json` 追加
- `package.json`: `x:setup`, `x:post`, `yt:setup`, `yt:post` スクリプト追加、`twitter-api-v2` 依存追加

**新規スプレッドシート:**

### 2026-02-18: 02-architecture.md 図のアライメント修正

**課題**: 02-architecture.md内の全ASCII art図で、CJK文字（日本語）を含む行の右罫線（│）がズレていた。ユーザーが46枚のスクリーンショットで問題を報告。

**根本原因の発見**: Webブラウザ（GitHub）のモノスペースフォントはCJK文字を約1.7倍幅でレンダリングする（Unicode標準の2.0倍ではない）。これにより、CJK文字が多い行ほど右罫線が左にずれる。

**修正内容（2段階）**:

Phase 1 (commit `12272a7`): Unicode視覚幅の正規化
- Pythonスクリプト（`/tmp/fix_alignment.py`）でCJK=2カラムとして全行の視覚幅を統一
- 33コードブロック、985行を修正

Phase 2 (commit `3d4a7ac`): CJKピクセル幅補正
- Playwrightで実測: ASCII=8.16px, カタカナ=13.91px(1.705x), 漢字=13.59px(1.666x)
- 行ごとに `round(N_cjk × 0.31)` 個の追加スペースを挿入
- 734行を追加修正
- 最大ズレ: 67px（約8文字）→ 8px（約1文字）に改善

**測定結果（ボックス型図表）**:
- Layer図（79行）: ±1.0文字
- 通信フロー（14行）: ±1.0文字
- LangGraph Runtime（45行）: ±0.9文字
- 戦略サイクル（26行）: ±1.3文字
- 制作パイプライン（39行）: ±0.8文字

**技術的制約**: CJK幅比率はブラウザ/OS/フォントにより異なるため、完全なズレゼロは不可能。補正値0.31はChromium/Linux測定値。macOS (SF Mono + Hiragino) では若干異なる可能性あり。

**ツール**: `/tmp/check_alignment.py`（分析）, `/tmp/fix_alignment.py`（Phase 1）, `/tmp/fix_alignment_v3_compensate.py`（Phase 2）

### 2026-02-18: 03-database-schema.md レビュー + 全specファイル整合性修正

## Session: Body Section — Fabric 1.0 Integration (2026-02-18)

### 背景
チームメイトからの要望: Body セクションのみ「モーション→リップシンク」ではなく、VEED Fabric 1.0 (`veed/fabric-1.0`) を使って「画像と音声から直接リップシンク」に変更。動画として自然になるため。

### 変更内容

**新規ファイル**:
- `pipeline/media/fabric-generator.js` — Fabric 1.0 API呼び出しモジュール

**変更ファイル**:
- `pipeline/orchestrator.js` — Body セクションのみ Fabric パスに分岐
  - Hook/CTA: 従来通り (Kling motion-control + TTS並列 → Sync Lipsync)
  - Body: TTS → Fabric 1.0 (image + audio → lip-synced video 直接生成)
- `tests/pipeline.test.js` — Fabric 関連テスト 7件追加 (Test 76-82)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Body フロー・図・API テーブル更新
- `README.md` — パイプラインフロー・API テーブル・コスト構造更新
- `docs/manuals/OPERATIONS.md` — 自動化リスト・実行フロー・環境変数説明を更新
- `docs/cost-analysis/per-video-cost.md` — Hook/CTA vs Body のコスト内訳を分離、構成比更新
- `docs/cost-analysis/per-minute-cost.md` — ブレンドレート方式に更新、Fabric 1.0 セクション追加
- `docs/cost-analysis/full-system-design.md` — Phase 5・月次コスト表・総コストサマリー全面更新

**コスト変更** (1動画3セクション):
- 旧: Hook $0.77 + Body $0.77 + CTA $0.77 = **$2.31**
- 新 Pro: Hook $0.77 + Body $0.75 (Fabric 720p) + CTA $0.77 = **$2.29**
- 新 Std: Hook $0.60 + Body $0.75 (Fabric 720p) + CTA $0.60 = **$1.95**
- 注: Std構成は旧$1.80→$1.95に増加（Fabric $0.75 > Kling+Std Lipsync $0.60 のため）

**技術詳細**:
- Fabric 1.0 endpoint: `veed/fabric-1.0` (fal.ai partner model)
- Input: `image_url` + `audio_url` + `resolution: "720p"`
- Output: `result.video.url` (MP4)
- 既存の `@fal-ai/client` npm パッケージ + `FAL_KEY` でそのまま使用可能
- Body ではモーション動画のアップロード不要（Fabric が画像から直接生成）

**テスト**: 全460テスト合格 (12スイート、3回連続安定)

### 2026-02-19: Session 7 — 日次モニタリングスクリプト作成

**目的**: v5.0並列実装フェーズ（10エージェント）の日次進捗・品質・アンチパターン監視を自動化

**作成物**:
- `v5/scripts/daily-report.sh` — 日次モニタリングスクリプト（6セクション）
- `v5/logs/.gitkeep` — ログ保存ディレクトリ（Gitに含める）
- cron設定: 毎日UTC 0:00に自動実行

**レポート内容** (6セクション):
1. **進捗サマリー**: feature_list.json ベース（全体・カテゴリ別・エージェント別、プログレスバー付き）
2. **直近の活動**: progress.txt 最新30行、ブロッカー検出、当日COMPLETE数
3. **アンチパターン検出**: AP1(One-shotting), AP4(E2E Skip), AP9(Config Hardcoding), AP10(Type Bypass)
4. **Git統計**: 昨日からのコミット数、著者別
5. **コード品質**: lint/TypeScript/テスト状況
6. **環境ヘルスチェック**: Docker/DB接続/ディスク使用量

**運用フロー**:
- 毎日0:00 UTCに自動実行 → `v5/logs/daily-report-YYYY-MM-DD.txt` に保存 → auto git commit & push
- GitHubアプリからスマホで `v5/logs/` を開くだけで確認可能
- `.gitignore` に `!v5/logs/` 例外を追加（ルートの `logs/` ルールを上書き）

**設計判断**:
- progress.txt/src/ が未存在でもエラーにならない（実装フェーズ前の現時点で動作確認済み）
- feature_list.json は251件（10エージェント、11カテゴリ）を正しく読み取り

**13-agent-harness.md 付録クロスリファレンス追加**:
- 付録A/B/Cが本文から一度も参照されておらず、エージェントが存在に気付けない問題を修正
- §1.2 Phase A → 付録B（エージェント起動テンプレート）
- §2.2 変更ルール → 付録C（feature_list.json 生成チェックリスト）
- §8.3 npm scripts → 付録A（完全なscripts定義）

**13-agent-harness.md 数値・パス不整合修正**:
- §1.1, §1.5, §2.4, §10.2, §11.1: 機能数 300 → 251（feature_list.json実数に合わせる）
- §5.2 Step 1: 作業ディレクトリパス `/home/pochi/workspaces/work/ai-influencer-v5` → `/home/pochi/workspaces/work/ai-influencer/v5`
- MCPツール数(102)は仕様書全体で一貫しており修正不要と確認

**v5/CLAUDE.md 作成 + 10→13 クロスリファレンス追加**:
- `v5/CLAUDE.md`: Agent Team起動時の自動読み込みエントリポイント。10 + 13 + 12 の必読指示、コアルール、gitルール、クイックリファレンスを記載

**変更内容** (18ファイル, 291挿入, 69削除):

1. **新規MCPツール (3件)**: `create_character_profile`, `generate_character_image`, `select_voice_profile`
   - 配置: `mcp-server/tools/entity/` (mcp-core-agent担当) — 分類基準「ツールが主にCRUD操作するテーブルで分類」に従い`characters`テーブル操作のためentity/
   - MCP合計: 89→92, 総ツール数: 102→105 (REST 13は変更なし)

2. **新規system_settings (3件)**: `CHARACTER_AUTO_GENERATION_ENABLED` (bool, false), `CHARACTER_REVIEW_REQUIRED` (bool, true), `CHARACTER_GENERATION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` (float, 0.8)
   - 合計: 81→84 (agent: 38→41)

3. **DBスキーマ拡張** (`characters`テーブル):
   - 3新列: `status` (draft/pending_review/active/archived), `created_by` (human/curator), `generation_metadata` (JSONB)
   - 2新インデックス: `idx_characters_status`, `idx_characters_created_by`
   - 合計インデックス: 133→135

## Session 14 (2026-02-19): 全仕様ファイルレビュー + per-content学習アーキテクチャ再設計

### 概要
残りの10ファイル (01-09, 11) の全セクションレビューを実施。最大の変更はアルゴリズム学習サイクルを「日次」から「per-content（コンテンツ単位）」に再設計し、精度上限を65-70%→92%に引き上げたこと。

### 主要変更

**1. Per-Content マイクロサイクル学習の導入 (04-agent-design.md)**

- 2つの新system_settings: MICRO_ANALYSIS_MAX_DURATION_SEC (30), CROSS_NICHE_LEARNING_THRESHOLD (0.75)

**2. アルゴリズム精度の再計算 (08-algorithm-analysis.md)**
- 精度上限: 65-70% → 92%
- 12ヶ月後予測: 88-93%
- スケール優位性: 6月 = 3,000+コンテンツ/日 = 90,000+学習イベント/月

**3. KPI再計算 (07-kpi-analysis.md)**
- 月間精度予測をper-content学習ボリュームで再計算
- 学習イベント数 (日次サイクル数ではなく) で効果を計算

**4. 6エージェントプロンプト全面書き換え (04-agent-design.md §19)**
- YouTube, X, Zenn, Qiita等のプロンプトエンジニアリングリサーチを反映
- Chain-of-thought, few-shot, self-reflection, structured outputパターン適用
- ~220行 → ~800行 (全6エージェント合計)

**5. ORM統一 (01, 02, 03)**
- Prisma/Drizzle混在を全てDrizzle ORMに統一

**6. 水平線削除**
- 全5ファイル (06, 10, 11, 12, 13) から45本の `---` 水平線を削除

- Fish Audio TTS の 429 (rate limit) がリトライ対象外だったバグを修正
- 429 + fetch failed を isTransient に追加。429 は待機時間2倍（4s→10s→20s）
- concurrency 5 で同時TTS 15呼び出し → レート制限抵触 → リトライで自動回復

**量産実行結果**: VID_202602_0109〜0123（15本）全て completed
- concat解像度正規化: Fabric 1.0 (736x1312@25fps) + Kling+Lipsync (720x1280@30fps) → 720x1280@30fps 統一 → black frame なし
- 平均処理時間: ~600-700秒/本

### 2026-02-20: Session 17 — アルゴリズム-KPI設計メモ全統合 (21ファイル, +3,987行)

**概要**: `algorithm-kpi-design.md` (821行) の確定仕様を v5仕様 13ファイル + v5コード 7ファイル + README に完全統合。Agent Team (3チームメイト並列) で実行。

**3つの重要命名修正**:
- `measurement_round` (INTEGER) → `measurement_point` (VARCHAR: '48h', '7d', '30d')
- `comp.metadata` → `comp.data`
- `bgm_category` を audio component_data JSOBスキーマに追加

**新規テーブル (6)**:
- `algorithm_weights`, `algorithm_adjustment_logs`, `prediction_logs`, `platform_baselines`, `kpi_snapshots`, `account_monthly_stats`

**新規 system_settings (31)**: アルゴリズム関連 — 初期重み、クリッピング閾値、ベースライン最小投稿数、予測精度目標など

**主要セクション追加**:
- **08-algorithm-analysis.md** (+986行): §15-27 — インプレッション予測アルゴリズム確定仕様（ベースライン算出、重み調整、クリッピング、エッジケース、新settings一覧）
- **07-kpi-analysis.md** (+211行): §10 — KPI達成率・予測精度の確定仕様（数式、SQL、加重平均集約、エッジケース）
- **05-cost-analysis.md** (+115行): §10 — アルゴリズム学習システムのコスト（micro $0.018/本、cumulative $0.035/本、月額$80-$5,566）
- **09-risks-and-bottlenecks.md** (+47行): §3.9 — アルゴリズムリスク R-24〜R-29
- **03-database-schema.md** (+769行): 6 CREATE TABLE、seed設定、JSONB拡張
- **04-agent-design.md** (+265行): エージェントプロンプト・ワークフローにアルゴリズム統合
- **12-test-specifications.md** (+379行): アルゴリズムテスト追加
- **02-architecture.md** (+224行): アーキテクチャ図・フロー更新
- **v5/feature_list.json** (+308行): 新機能追加
- **v5/sql/** (+187行): CREATE TABLE、INDEX、seed
- **v5/types/** (+501行): TypeScript型定義追加

**更新された数値**:
| 項目 | 旧値 | 新値 |
|------|------|------|
| テーブル数 | 27 | 33 (+6 algorithm/KPI) |
| system_settings数 | 87 | 118 (+31 algorithm) |
| インデックス数 | 139 | 146 (+7) |
| 機能数 (features) | 261 | 276 (+15) |
| テスト数 | 459 | 489 (+30) |
| 総ツール数 (MCP+REST) | 111 | 116 (+5 unique, §4.3/§4.12で3ツール共有) |
