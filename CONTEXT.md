## Session History

### 2026-02-06: Project Initialization (v1.0)

**What was done:**
- Created project folder structure
- Created initial documentation (README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, CONTEXT.md)
- Defined GAS project structure with component breakdown
- Established Google Sheets schema for multi-platform metrics

**Key decisions:**
1. **GAS over GCP VM**: Chose Google Apps Script for simplicity and native Sheets integration
2. **video_uid linking**: Each video gets a unique ID to link across platforms
3. **CSV-first approach**: Platform APIs have severe limitations. CSV export is the primary data source

### 2026-02-06: Phase 2-5 Implementation (v1.0)

**What was done:**
- CSV parsers, normalizers, linkers, KPI engine, LLM analyzer, sheet writer
- 223 tests across 6 test suites
- n8n integration documentation
- Sample CSV files

### 2026-02-09: Complete v2.0 Rebuild

**Why v2.0 was needed:**
- v1.0 was analytics-only (CSV import and analysis). It had no concept of video production lifecycle, no component management, and no way to track which content elements contributed to performance.
- v2.0 adds the complete production loop: component inventories, production workflow, approval gates, component-aware AI analysis, and performance scoring.

**What was done:**

- **Phase 1: Foundation**
  - `Config.gs` - Complete rewrite with Drive structure, master columns, component types, ID prefixes, KPI defaults, column aliases, dropdown options, colors
  - `Utils.gs` - Added readSheetAsObjects, findRowByColumn, findAllRowsByColumn, updateRowByIndex, ID generators (generateVideoUid, generateComponentId, generateScenarioId, generateMotionId, generateCharacterId, generateAudioId), getInventoryTypeFromId, getComponentById, getComponentsById
  - `Setup.gs` - One-click system setup: creates Drive folders (Scenarios/Motions/Characters/Audio/Analytics with subfolders), inventory spreadsheets (4 separate spreadsheets), all master sheet tabs, demo data, KPI defaults, formatting (dropdowns, conditional colors, checkbox)
  - `Migration.gs` - v1 to v2 migration (renames videos_master to master, adds new columns, creates video_analysis sheet, updates recommendations schema)

- **Phase 2: Data Layer**
  - `ComponentManager.gs` (NEW) - Component CRUD (addComponent, updateComponent, archiveComponent), listComponents with filters (type/status/tags), getTopPerformingComponents, buildVideoComponentContext, incrementComponentUsage, getComponentPerformanceHistory, buildRecommendationComponentPool
  - `MasterManager.gs` (NEW) - Master sheet operations (createProduction, getVideosByStatus, getApprovedVideos, getProductionData), production workflow (updateVideoStatus, approveVideo), updateMetricsSnapshot, writeAIRecommendations, updateAnalysisResults, getAllVideoUids, getMasterData
  - `ScoreUpdater.gs` (NEW) - updateAllComponentScores, calculateAvgScore, updateComponentScoresForVideo, updateSingleComponentScore, normalizeOverallScore, getScoreSummary

- **Phase 3: Analysis Extension**
  - `LLMAnalyzer.gs` - Rewritten with component-aware prompts (analyzWithLLMEnhanced), includes component history and top performers in AI context, generates component-specific recommendations via separate prompt, single-video analysis with component context
  - `Linker.gs` - Updated for v2.0 master sheet references, added updateMasterMetricsSnapshot
  - `KPIEngine.gs` - Added normalizeOverallScore for cross-platform scoring
  - `SheetWriter.gs` - Added writeToInventory, writeVideoAnalysis, writeRecommendationsEnhanced, clearAllData

- **Phase 4: Integration**
  - `Code.gs` - Complete rewrite with 13 API actions (doGet: get_status, get_approved, get_production, get_components, get_score_summary; doPost: import_csv, analyze, analyze_single, analyze_all, link_videos, create_production, approve_video, update_status, add_component, update_component, get_components, update_scores)
  - UI menu with submenus: Import CSV (YouTube/TikTok/Instagram), Analyze (Single/All), Production (Create/Approve/Status), Components (Add/Browse/Scores)

- **Phase 5: Testing**
  - 3 new test files: ComponentManager.test.js, MasterManager.test.js, ScoreUpdater.test.js
  - Updated all existing tests for v2.0 (master sheet references, removed scenario_cuts)
  - Updated setup.js with all v2.0 utility mocks
  - **330 tests passing across 9 test suites**

- **Phase 6: Documentation**
  - Updated all documentation for v2.0

**Key v2.0 decisions:**
1. **Separate inventory spreadsheets**: Each component type (scenarios, motions, characters, audio) has its own spreadsheet, accessed via `SpreadsheetApp.openById()`
2. **Component ID system**: Prefix-based (SCN_H_, SCN_B_, SCN_C_, MOT_, CHR_, AUD_) for type identification
3. **Production workflow**: draft -> approved -> in_production -> published -> analyzed, with human approval gate
4. **Component-aware AI analysis**: AI receives full component context (history, scores, top performers) when analyzing

### 2026-02-09: v2.0.1 - Checkbox Bug Fix

**Problem:** The `human_approved` checkbox column in the master sheet was causing `getLastRow()` to return 101 instead of 2 (or the actual data row count), because `requireCheckbox()` data validation auto-fills `FALSE` into empty cells, making them appear as data rows.

**Fix:** Changed `applyMasterSheetFormatting_()` to only apply checkbox validation to rows that have actual data (checked `sheet.getLastRow()` before applying), rather than applying to a range of 100 rows.

**Commit:** `62f7400 Fix insertDemoData false positive: checkbox FALSE values triggered data check`

### 2026-02-09: v2.0.2 - appendRow Bug Fix

**Problem:** Because of the checkbox FALSE values filling up to row 101, `sheet.appendRow()` was writing new data at row 102 instead of the next available row after actual data.

**Fix:** Updated `insertDemoData()` to clear any existing rows (including checkbox FALSE values) before writing demo data, and then apply checkbox validation only to the data rows.

**Commit:** `4c36712 Fix checkbox causing appendRow to write at row 101 instead of row 2`

### 2026-02-09: v2.0.3 - Config Sheet Fallback for API Keys

**Problem:** Setting Script Properties via the Apps Script editor is cumbersome, especially for the OpenAI API key. The `_config` sheet in the spreadsheet provides a more accessible way to store configuration.

**What changed:**
- `Config.gs`: Added `getConfigFromSheet_()` function that reads from a `_config` sheet (columns: key, value, description) as a fallback when Script Properties are not set
- `Config.gs`: Added `migrateConfigToProperties()` to migrate _config sheet values to Script Properties
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` now reads from Script Properties first, then falls back to `_config` sheet

### 2026-02-09: v2.0.4 - Web App Access Configuration

**Problem:** The Web App was not accessible externally because `appsscript.json` had `oauthScopes` configured (for bound script) but no `webapp` section. The webapp needed to be accessible without authentication for n8n integration.

**What changed:**
- `appsscript.json`: Replaced `oauthScopes` array with `webapp` configuration:
  ```json
  "webapp": {
    "access": "ANYONE_ANONYMOUS",
    "executeAs": "USER_DEPLOYING"
  }
  ```
- This allows anyone with the deployment URL to access the Web App endpoints
- OAuth scopes are inferred automatically by GAS for bound scripts

### 2026-02-09: OAuth Setup for Google Sheets/Drive API

**Purpose:** Enable Claude Code to directly read/write to Google Sheets and Drive for E2E testing and debugging.

**What was set up:**
- Created OAuth 2.0 credentials in Google Cloud Console (project: video-analytics-hub)
- Created `scripts/gsheet.py` CLI utility for direct Sheets/Drive API access
- Token stored in `.gsheets_token.json` (gitignored)
- OAuth client credentials in `video_analytics_hub_claude_code_oauth.json` (gitignored)
- MCP servers configured in `.mcp.json` for google-workspace and google-sheets integration (gitignored)

### 2026-02-09: E2E Testing Results

**End-to-end testing was performed against the live spreadsheet:**
- Confirmed all 9 sheet tabs exist with correct headers
- Confirmed master sheet has 3 demo videos (2 analyzed, 1 draft)
- Confirmed metrics sheets have data for analyzed videos
- Confirmed KPI targets are set with default values
- Confirmed component inventories are connected and populated with demo data
- All 330 unit tests pass

### 2026-02-09: LLM Analysis Execution (Live Test)

**Live test of the analysis pipeline was verified:**
- OpenAI API key configured via `_config` sheet (auto-migrated to Script Properties)
- `analyzeVideoSingle` and `analyzeAllVideosEnhanced` functions tested via GAS editor execution
- Analysis writes to `video_analysis` and `recommendations` sheets
- Component scores updated after analysis
- AI-recommended components written to `ai_next_*` columns

### 2026-02-09: MANUAL.md Creation

**Created comprehensive Japanese-language user manual (`MANUAL.md`):**
- Complete system overview with architecture diagrams (ASCII art)
- Detailed Google Drive data structure documentation
- All spreadsheet schemas with column descriptions
- Component management workflows
- Video production lifecycle documentation
- CSV import procedures for all 3 platforms
- Analysis and KPI explanation
- AI recommendation and approval flow
- n8n/API integration guide with all endpoint specifications
- GAS menu operation guide
- Troubleshooting section
- Initial setup instructions

### 2026-02-09: v2.1.0 - Documentation Update and .gitignore Hardening

**What was done:**
- Updated CONTEXT.md with complete project history
- Added `.mcp.json` and `tmp/` to `.gitignore` to prevent credential leaks
- Verified all documentation files are consistent with v2.0 codebase
- Committed, pushed, and deployed to Apps Script

### 2026-02-09: v3.0.0 - AI-Influencer Pipeline

**Why:** Pivot from analytics-only tool to a full content production pipeline. The existing GAS analytics (v2.0) handles post-publication analysis well, but the upstream workflow (video generation → platform posting) was manual via n8n. This version adds an automated Node.js pipeline to handle end-to-end content production at scale (50 → 700 accounts).

**What was done:**

- **Project restructure**: Renamed conceptually from "Video Analytics Hub" to "AI-Influencer" to reflect the broader scope
- **Created `pipeline/` directory** with modular Node.js architecture:
  - `pipeline/config.js` - Environment configuration and API key management
  - `pipeline/orchestrator.js` - Pipeline orchestration (scenario → video → post)
  - `pipeline/sheets/reader.js` - Google Sheets API reader (scenarios, accounts)
  - `pipeline/sheets/writer.js` - Google Sheets API writer (pipeline status, results)
  - `pipeline/media/kling.js` - fal.ai Kling video generation
  - `pipeline/media/tts.js` - fal.ai ElevenLabs TTS
  - `pipeline/media/lipsync.js` - fal.ai Lipsync processing
  - `pipeline/media/creatify.js` - Creatify video composition
  - `pipeline/storage/drive.js` - Google Drive upload/management
  - `pipeline/posting/youtube.js` - YouTube Data API v3 posting
  - `pipeline/posting/instagram.js` - Instagram Graph API posting
  - `pipeline/posting/tiktok.js` - TikTok Content Posting API
  - `pipeline/posting/x.js` - X/Twitter v2 API posting
- **Created `scripts/` entry points**:
  - `scripts/run-pipeline.js` - Single video pipeline execution
  - `scripts/run-daily.js` - Daily batch execution for all accounts
  - `scripts/collect-metrics.js` - Metrics collection from platforms
- **New Google Sheets tabs designed**:
  - `accounts` - Platform account management (account_id, platform, credentials_ref, status, daily limits)
  - `content_pipeline` - Pipeline execution log (pipeline_id, video_uid, account_id, job IDs, status, cost)
- **Documentation rewrite**:
  - `STRATEGY.md` (NEW) - Strategy, KPI targets, revenue model, meeting notes, decision log
  - `README.md` - Complete rewrite for AI-Influencer scope
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete rewrite with Pipeline + Analytics architecture
  - `CONTEXT.md` - Appended this session

**Key decisions:**
1. **Node.js pipeline (not GAS)**: GAS has 6-minute timeout and can't handle long-running video generation. Node.js runs on local/server with no timeout constraints
2. **fal.ai as media hub**: Consolidates Kling, ElevenLabs, and Lipsync under one API provider
3. **Google Sheets as DB**: Continues using Sheets for simplicity and compatibility with existing GAS analytics
4. **YouTube first for MVP**: Most stable API, fastest path to revenue
5. **Existing GAS analytics unchanged**: The 14 GAS files and 330 tests remain untouched

**Phase plan:**
- Phase 1 (2/10-12): MVP - 1 account, YouTube auto-posting
- Phase 2 (2/13-17): 12 YouTube + 12 Instagram accounts
- Phase 3 (2/18-28): All 50 accounts across 4 platforms

### 2026-02-10: Phase 0 - Content Generation Pipeline Implementation

**Why:** The n8n workflow analysis revealed 5 critical differences between the existing pipeline code and the actual production workflow. The pipeline needed to be rewritten to match the real n8n flow exactly.

**What was done:**

- **n8n workflow analysis**: Analyzed `ワークフロー.json` and `senario_template.xlsx` to extract the real 3-step process (Kling → TTS → Lipsync, no Creatify Aurora)
- **Created `pipeline/data/scenario.json`**: Extracted 3 sections (hook, body, cta) with scripts and motion reference video Drive IDs (`motionVideoDriveId`)
- **Fixed media module endpoints**:
  - `video-generator.js`: `image-to-video` → `motion-control` with `video_url`, `character_orientation` (NO `prompt` or `keep_original_sound` — causes 422)
  - `tts-generator.js`: `tts/v3` → `tts/eleven-v3` with voice name "Aria" instead of voice_id
  - `lipsync.js`: `v2` → `v2/pro` with `sync_mode: "bounce"`
- **Added fal.storage upload**: `uploadToFalStorage()` and `downloadFromDrive()` in `fal-client.js` — replaces Cloudinary with Drive → fal.storage → API pattern
- **Created ffmpeg concat utility**: `pipeline/media/concat.js` using concat demuxer for combining 3 section videos
- **Rewrote orchestrator**: New 3-section loop — downloads motion video from Drive per section → fal.storage → Kling → TTS → Lipsync, then ffmpeg concat + Drive upload (4 files) + sheet logging
- **Rewrote CLI**: `--character-folder <DRIVE_FOLDER_ID>` replaces `--account`
- **Deleted Cloudinary and Compositor modules**: Removed `compositor.js`, `cloudinary.js`, cloudinary config and dependency
- **Updated content_pipeline sheet schema**: New columns (character_folder_id, section_count, hook/body/cta_video_url, drive_folder_id)
- **Updated content-manager.js**: HEADERS array matches new sheet schema
- **Created pipeline test suite**: 21 tests covering modules, endpoints, ffmpeg, CLI, schema, edge cases
- **Updated Jest config**: Projects-based config for both GAS and pipeline test suites
- **E2E success**: First full pipeline run completed — CNT_202602_2916 (54MB final video, 3 sections)
  - Uploaded CHR_0001_v1.jpg to `Characters/Images/CHR_0001/`
  - Fixed `FAL_KEY || FAL_AI_KEY` fallback in config.js
  - Replaced dead Cloudinary URLs in scenario.json with Drive file IDs (motionVideoDriveId)
  - Removed invalid `prompt: ''` and `keep_original_sound: true` params from video-generator
  - Output: `Productions/2026-02-10/CNT_202602_2916/` with 4 MP4 files uploaded to Drive
  - content_pipeline sheet updated with status=completed and all Drive links
- **README.md rewritten**: Comprehensive specification document with pipeline flow, service descriptions, Drive folder structure, all Sheets schemas with column-level documentation, setup, usage, cost structure

**Key decisions:**
1. **Creatify Aurora removed**: n8n workflow doesn't use it — the 3-step process (Kling → TTS → Lipsync) is sufficient
2. **Cloudinary → fal.storage**: All persistent files in Drive, temporary URLs via fal.storage. No external image hosting needed
3. **3-section structure**: Each video consists of hook + body + cta, processed independently then concatenated
4. **ffmpeg for concatenation**: Simple `concat demuxer` with `-c copy` (no re-encoding) for fast joining
5. **Drive folder structure**: Productions/YYYY-MM-DD/CNT_XXXX/ with 4 files per content
6. **Motion videos from Drive**: scenario.json stores Drive file IDs (not URLs), orchestrator downloads + uploads to fal.storage per section

**Test results:** 357 tests passing (330 GAS + 27 pipeline)

### 2026-02-10: v4.0 - Production Rebuild

**Why:** Phase 0 proved the E2E pipeline works, but it relied on demo data and sequential processing. To hit the 36 videos/day target for 50 accounts by February, the system needed: (1) real data in all inventories, (2) parallel processing for speed, (3) proper inventory management modules, and (4) a production-grade tracking tab.

**What was done:**

- **Demo data → real data migration**:
  - Cleared all demo data from 4 inventory spreadsheets (Scenarios, Motions, Characters, Audio)
  - Populated inventories with real data from テンプレ.xlsx
  - Uploaded 3 motion videos to Drive (Hooks/Bodies/CTAs folders)

- **Accounts Inventory** (new spreadsheet):
  - 7 platform accounts configured
  - 12 Gmail credentials registered

- **Production tab** (new, 33 columns):
  - Replaces content_pipeline for new pipeline runs
  - Tracks video_id, all inventory IDs used, scripts, output URLs, processing time, cost, error details
  - content_pipeline tab preserved for backward compatibility (v3.1 records remain)

- **New pipeline modules**:
  - `pipeline/sheets/inventory-reader.js`: Reads from all 4 inventory spreadsheets, resolves component IDs to Drive file IDs and metadata
  - `pipeline/sheets/production-manager.js`: Creates/updates rows in the production tab, manages status transitions

- **Orchestrator parallelization** (`pipeline/orchestrator.js` rewrite):
  - 3 sections now processed in parallel via `Promise.all`
  - Within each section, Kling video generation and TTS run in parallel
  - Only Lipsync runs sequentially (requires both video and audio as input)
  - Processing time reduced from ~35min to ~12min per video

- **CLI update** (`scripts/run-pipeline.js`):
  - New flags: `--video-id <ID>`, `--limit <N>`
  - `--character-folder` deprecated (still works for backward compatibility)
  - Pipeline reads from inventory sheets instead of scenario.json

- **Deprecations**:
  - `pipeline/data/scenario.json`: No longer the primary data source; inventories are used instead
  - `--character-folder` CLI flag: Replaced by `--video-id`

- **Config updates** (`pipeline/config.js`):
  - Added `ACCOUNTS_SPREADSHEET_ID` for Accounts Inventory
  - Added `productionTab` configuration

**Key decisions:**
1. **Parallel Promise.all for 3 sections**: Each section is independent until lipsync, so process all 3 simultaneously
2. **Kling + TTS parallel within sections**: Video generation and audio generation don't depend on each other
3. **Production tab replaces content_pipeline for new runs**: Cleaner schema with 33 columns, keeps legacy data intact
4. **Inventory-driven pipeline**: scenario.json was static and limiting; reading from Sheets allows dynamic content selection
5. **Backward compatibility maintained**: `--character-folder` still works, content_pipeline tab preserved

**Files changed/created:**
- New: `pipeline/sheets/inventory-reader.js`, `pipeline/sheets/production-manager.js`
- Modified: `pipeline/orchestrator.js` (parallel rewrite), `pipeline/config.js` (accounts ID, productionTab), `scripts/run-pipeline.js` (new CLI flags)
- Deprecated: `pipeline/data/scenario.json`
- Docs: `STRATEGY.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `README.md`, `CONTEXT.md` all updated

**New Resource IDs:**
| Resource | ID |
|----------|-----|
| Accounts Inventory | `1CmT6C3qCW3md6lJ9Rvc2WNQkWa5zcvlq6Zp_enJHoUE` |

**Test results:** 357 tests passing (330 GAS + 27 pipeline)

**Bug fixes (same session):**
- `drive_file_id` column missing from Motions/Characters inventories → added to both
- `extractDriveFileId()` helper added to orchestrator.js: defensive fallback that extracts file ID from `drive_file_id` field or parses it from `file_link` URL patterns
- `fal-client.js`: enriched error messages now include fal.ai body details (e.g., balance exhausted reason)

**E2E real API result (v4.0 parallel pipeline — SUCCESS):**
- VID_202602_0001: 3 sections parallel, 1030s (17.2min) total
- Hook: 9.2MB, Body: 78.4MB, CTA: 17.3MB, Final: 104.9MB (100MB)
- Drive folder: `1IiMhXW7WfyCWADSj-aNF_-AWuzuv-pyy`
- Production tab auto-updated: pipeline_status=completed, all 4 video URLs, processing_time=1030s
- All API steps succeeded: character upload → 3× (motion upload + Kling + TTS parallel + Lipsync) → ffmpeg → Drive

**New documentation:**
- `OPERATIONS.md`: 667-line Japanese operations manual for human operators
  - Covers: inventory management, production workflow, CLI usage, troubleshooting, cost reference

### 2026-02-11: Documentation Audit & Reorganization

**Why:** ドキュメントが根幹レベルに散乱し、技術情報とビジネス情報が混在し、同じ情報が複数ファイルに重複していた。50→3,500アカウントのスケーリングに備え、チームメイトが迷わず参照できる体制を整備。

**What was done:**

- **ファイル構造の再編成**:
  - `STRATEGY.md` → `docs/STRATEGY.md`
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` → `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `OPERATIONS.md` → `docs/manuals/OPERATIONS.md`
  - `MANUAL.md` → `docs/manuals/GAS_MANUAL.md`
  - `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` → `docs/manuals/USER_GUIDE.md`
  - `docs/account-design-guide.md` → `docs/manuals/account-design-guide.md`
  - ルートには `README.md` と `CONTEXT.md` のみ残す

- **ドキュメントポリシー確立**:
  - **README.md**: 技術SSOT（スキーマ、コスト、Drive構造の唯一の定義場所）
  - **docs/STRATEGY.md**: ビジネス専用（KPI、収益、フェーズ、リスク、意思決定）— 技術的な仕様は含めない
  - **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md**: システム全体図、データフロー図、モジュール一覧
  - **docs/manuals/**: 人間オペレーター向けガイド
  - **重複禁止**: 各情報は1箇所のみに記載し、他はクロスリファレンス

- **重複コンテンツの除去**:
  - ARCHITECTURE.md: Sheetsスキーマ（110行）、コストセクション（20行）を削除 → README参照に変更
  - OPERATIONS.md: コスト参考（27行）、スプレッドシートスキーマ一覧（82行）を削除 → README参照に変更

- **KPI数値更新**（マスターシート.xlsxから）:
  - 5月: 520 → **1,480** アカウント
  - 6月: 700 → **3,500** アカウント

- **クロスリファレンス修正**: 全ファイルのマークダウンリンクを新パスに更新

- **account-design-guide.md**: チームメイト向けアカウント設計ガイド作成（ペルソナ設計、画像準備、シナリオ作成、インベントリ登録手順、テンプレート、FAQ）

- **セキュリティ監査**: git履歴・全ファイルをスキャンし、シークレット漏洩がないことを確認

**Commits:**
- `85ae670` Docs: audit cleanup — add docs index, fix stale refs, remove secrets
- `940ca10` Docs: add account design guide + tech stack table
- `6f4db09` Docs: reorganize structure, deduplicate content, update KPI numbers

### 2026-02-11: コスト分析 & システム設計ドキュメント

**Why:** コスト計算が10秒ベースで算出されていたが、実際のパイプライン設定は5秒/セクション。正確な単価に修正し、ステークホルダー向けの詳細コスト分析レポートを作成。また、50→3,500アカウントスケーリングに向けた全体システム設計と SNS API 調査が必要だった。

**What was done:**

- **コスト修正** ($3.72/本 → $2.34/本):
  - Kling: $0.70 → $0.35（5秒×$0.07/秒）
  - ElevenLabs: ~$0.04 → ~$0.01
  - Lipsync: $0.50 → $0.42（5秒/60×$5.00/分）
  - README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, OPERATIONS.md を全て更新

- **新規ドキュメント**:
  - `docs/cost-analysis/per-video-cost.md`: 1動画あたりのAPI費用内訳
  - `docs/cost-analysis/per-minute-cost.md`: 分単価比較（API vs GUI、他社サービス比較）
  - `docs/cost-analysis/full-system-design.md`: 全9フェーズのシステム設計書（614行）
    - 市場リサーチ → アカウント設計 → コンテンツ作成 → 投稿 → 計測 → 分析 → 改善のフルループ
    - 月別コスト試算（2月〜6月）、Pro/Std 2プラン比較
    - インフラ構成、並列化戦略、レート制限分析
  - `docs/research/SNS_API_RESEARCH.md`: 4プラットフォームのAPI調査レポート（615行）
    - YouTube / TikTok / Instagram / X の投稿API仕様、制限、認証方式

- **STRATEGY.md更新**: システム設計書・SNS研究へのクロスリファレンス追加

**Commits:**
- `9ef6f94` Docs: add cost analysis reports, fix API pricing across all docs
- `0e3f3eb` Docs: add full system design & SNS API research for 50→3,500 account scaling

### 2026-02-11: ローカル開発環境セットアップ & ドキュメント修正

**Why:** Tailscale VPNの接続不安定（東京リレー障害、全リージョン~2sレイテンシ）により、VM上での開発作業が困難に。GitHubからローカルにクローンして作業環境を構築。

**What was done:**

- **ローカル環境構築**:
  - `gh repo clone Ceed-dev/ai-influencer` で ~/Programming/ai-influencer にクローン
  - SCP経由でVMから秘密ファイル3点を取得: `.env`, `.gsheets_token.json`, `video_analytics_hub_claude_code_oauth.json`
  - `npm install` 実行（313パッケージ）
  - Google Sheets API接続確認（productionタブ読取OK）
  - Google Drive API接続確認
  - 全357テストパス（330 GAS + 27 pipeline）

- **STRATEGY.md修正**:
  - 投稿頻度の記述を修正: 「7本/週」→「1日1本/アカウント（日次総投稿数 = 稼働アカウント数）」
  - 分析・改善フェーズのステータスを🟢自動 → 🔴実装途中に修正（基盤実装済みだが本番運用未開始）
  - 市場リサーチ用シート準備タスクを直近の優先事項に追加（2/14使用開始、Badhan作成→駿冴FB）

**Key notes:**
- VMのrefresh_tokenがローカルでもそのまま有効（ブラウザOAuth認証不要）
- client.jsの自動トークンリフレッシュ機構により、期限切れトークンも自動更新
- Tailscale Exit Nodeは未設定のため、一般インターネットはVPN経由せず直接アクセス

### 2026-02-12: パイプライン仕様確認 & 未実装機能の洗い出し

**Why:** 36動画/日の量産運用に向けて、現状のパイプラインが実際にそのスループットを達成できるかの確認。

**確認結果 — 現状のギャップ:**

1. **パイプラインは「レシピ実行器」**: productionシートに`edit_status=ready`の行がある場合のみ動画を生成する。何を作るか自体は決めない。つまり毎日36本作るには、毎日36行のレシピ（account_id, scenario_id, motion_id, character_id, audio_id, scripts）をproductionシートに書き込む必要がある。この自動化は未実装。

2. **プール制御（未実装）**: 動画プールが一定数（例:100本）溜まったら停止、消費されたら再開する仕組みがない。現状は手動で`--limit N`を叩く運用。

3. **動画並列生成（未実装）**: 現状は1本ずつ順次処理（各本内の3セクションは並列）。36本順次 = ~7.2時間。複数本の同時生成ロジックは未実装。

4. **投稿オペレーション手順書（未作成）**: 「毎日どのシートを見て、どこからDLして、投稿後にどこを更新するか」の手順書がない。

**fal.aiクレジット試算:**

### 2026-02-12: TTS Migration: ElevenLabs → Fish Audio

- Migrated TTS from ElevenLabs (fal.ai proxy) to Fish Audio (Hanabi AI Inc., 直接REST API — fal.ai とは完全に別サービス)
- Code changes: tts-generator.js (full rewrite), config.js (fishAudio section), orchestrator.js (referenceId param), inventory-reader.js (voice_id required validation)
- Removed deprecated `runPipeline` function and legacy CLI options (`--character-folder`)
- voice_id (Fish Audio reference_id) を必須化: 空欄だとパイプラインがエラー停止
- FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY 未設定時に明確なエラーメッセージを追加
- Cost reduction: ~90% on TTS ($0.01→$0.001 per section), per-video total $2.34→$2.31 (Pro)
- Fish Audio returns binary MP3 → uploaded to fal.storage for lipsync compatibility
- ドキュメント全体で fal.ai と Fish Audio を明確に分離（別サービスであることを明記）
- voice_models タブを Audio Inventory に作成（EN 10 + JA 10 = 20モデル）
- Production sheet VID_202602_0001 に voice_id 設定: `802e3bc2b27e49c2995d23ef70e6ac89` (Energetic Male)
- 358 tests passing (330 GAS + 28 pipeline)

## Technical Notes

### Platform CSV Column Variations

YouTube may change column names between exports. Known variations:
- "Views" / "View count" / "視聴回数"
- "Watch time (hours)" / "総再生時間（時間）"

TikTok variations:
- "Video views" / "Views"
- "Average watch time" / "Avg. watch time"

Instagram variations:
- "Plays" / "Views"
- "Reach" / "Accounts reached"

### GAS Limitations to Remember
- 6-minute execution timeout
- 20MB response size limit
- 100 triggers per user limit
- Properties Service: 500KB total, 9KB per property

### OpenAI Integration Notes
- Use TSV output format for structured responses (more reliable parsing than JSON)
- Batch multiple videos per request to reduce API calls
- Implement exponential backoff for rate limiting
- v2.0: Include component context for better recommendations

### v2.0 Component Score System
- Each analyzed video's overall_score contributes to its components' avg_performance_score
- Scores normalized 0-100 across platforms
- Top-performing components surfaced in AI recommendation prompts
- Score updates cascade: video analyzed -> master updated -> all linked components updated

### 2026-02-12: Pipeline GUI Execution — Sheet Button → Auto Generation

**What was done:**
- Added Pipeline submenu to Google Sheets UI (Video Analytics v2 > Pipeline)
- Created `gas/PipelineUI.gs` with queue/validate/status/stop handlers
- Added `getQueuedRows()` to `production-manager.js` (watcher-specific filter)
- Created `scripts/watch-pipeline.js` polling daemon (30s interval, PM2-managed)
- Created `ecosystem.config.js` for PM2 process management
- Added 5 pipeline tests (tests 28-32) and 13 GAS PipelineUI tests
- Updated OPERATIONS.md with GUI workflow as primary, CLI as "advanced"
- Updated ARCHITECTURE.md with watcher architecture diagram

**Key decisions:**
1. **GAS for UI only, Node.js for processing**: GAS handles menu/validation/status. All API calls run on VM.
2. **Polling over webhooks**: 30s polling is simpler and more reliable than GAS triggers or webhooks.
3. **queued vs queued_dry**: Two statuses allow dry-run from the same GUI workflow.
4. **1 job per poll**: Watcher processes 1 video at a time (completes before next poll).
5. **PM2 for process management**: Auto-restart, systemd integration, log management.

**New files:**
- `gas/PipelineUI.gs` — GAS Pipeline menu handlers
- `scripts/watch-pipeline.js` — Polling watcher daemon
- `ecosystem.config.js` — PM2 configuration
- `gas/tests/PipelineUI.test.js` — 13 GAS UI handler tests

**Test count: 376** (343 GAS / 10 suites + 33 pipeline / 1 suite)

### 2026-02-13: KPI達成可能性分析レポート作成

**Why:** 現行のフロー・仕様を前提に、6月までのKPI（50→3,500アカウント）がどの程度達成可能かを定量的に評価する必要があった。ステークホルダーへの現実的な見通しの共有と、優先施策の明確化が目的。

**What was done:**

- **`docs/KPI-FEASIBILITY-ANALYSIS.md`** 新規作成（504行、日本語）
  - プロジェクト全体（パイプラインコード、GASコード、全ドキュメント、テスト・設定）を網羅的に調査した上で分析
  - 8セクション構成: エグゼクティブサマリー / KPI目標整理 / 現状能力分析 / 月別達成可能性 / ボトルネック分析 / 収益予測の現実性 / 必要アクション / 結論

**分析結果サマリー:**

| 月 | KPI目標 | 現実的予測 | 達成率 | 主要制約 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2月 | 50 | 15〜30 | 30〜60% | fal.aiクレジット未購入、アカウント設計遅延 |
| 3月 | 160 | 30〜65 | 19〜41% | マルチワーカー未実装、2月の遅延波及 |
| 4月 | 340 | 50〜120 | 15〜35% | 投稿自動化が分岐点 |
| 5月 | 1,480 | 80〜250 | 5〜17% | アーキテクチャ世代交代の成否 |
| 6月 | 3,500 | 100〜400 | 3〜11% | 全自動化・大規模インフラ未完成 |

**特定した6つのボトルネック（影響度順）:**
1. 投稿の手動運用（致命的）— 4月340件/日が物理的上限
2. シングルワーカー構成（高）— 3月126本/日で既にキャパ超過
3. アカウント立ち上げの手動プロセス（高）— 5月に52件/日の新規が必要
4. インベントリ不足（中〜高）— シナリオ3本・モーション3本のみ
5. fal.ai同時タスク制限（中）— 5月以降エンタープライズ必須
6. Google Sheetsのスケーラビリティ（中）— 15ワーカー同時で競合リスク

**収益予測の検証:**
- STRATEGY.mdの収益予測（6月: ¥3.78億/月）は、全アカウントが一定フォロワー基盤を持つ前提
- 新規アカウントはフォロワーゼロからスタート、各プラットフォームの収益化条件達成に3〜12ヶ月要する
- 現実的な6月収益: ¥50万〜500万（計画比1〜1.3%）

**根本原因:** KPIが指数関数的成長（特に5月+335%）を要求するのに対し、システム開発・組織拡大は線形的にしか進められないギャップ

### 2026-02-13: KPI達成可能性分析 v2 — AI駆動シナリオ比較レポート

**Why:** v1レポートでは現行仕様ベースで6月KPI達成率3〜11%と評価。しかし「全自動化が完成した場合」「AIエージェントチームを基盤にした場合」という2つの追加シナリオの分析が必要だった。市場側の不確実性は許容すべきものとして扱い、システム側で改善可能な範囲に焦点を当てる。

**What was done:**

- **`docs/KPI-FEASIBILITY-ANALYSIS-v2-AI-DRIVEN.md`** 新規作成（約410行、日本語）
  - 3シナリオ比較: 現行(v1) / コード全自動化(A) / AIエージェントチーム(B)
  - Claude Code Agent Team の技術調査（実験的機能、コンテキスト制約、コスト構造）
  - エージェントチーム構成案（5班、20〜50エージェント）のアーキテクチャ図
  - 許容すべき不確実性の整理（コンテンツ品質、フォロワー獲得速度、規約リスク、学習効果）

- **`docs/KPI-FEASIBILITY-ANALYSIS.md`** 修正
  - ページ上部のblockquote書式を修正（項目間に空行挿入で改行表示に対応）

**3シナリオ比較結果:**

| シナリオ | 6月KPI達成率 | フル稼働までの期間 | 核心的な違い |
|---|---|---|---|
| 現行（v1） | 3〜11% | 未定 | 手動運用の限界 |
| A: コード全自動化 | 20〜51% | 3〜4ヶ月 | 開発リードタイムがボトルネック |
| B: AIエージェントチーム | 35〜71% | 即日〜数日 | 開発リードタイムゼロ |

**シナリオBの優位性:**
- コード開発の待ち時間がない（即日稼働）
- エージェント追加 = 処理能力追加（インフラ構築不要）
- 自律的エラー復旧、24時間稼働
- SNSアカウントの複利的成長（早期投稿開始が6月成果に指数関数的に寄与）

**残存する共通制約:**
- fal.ai処理時間（1動画12分は物理的制約）
- プラットフォームアカウント登録（CAPTCHA等は人手が必要）
- コンテンツ品質の市場適合（実データで検証するしかない）

### 2026-02-13: アルゴリズムとコンテンツ量の関係性分析

**Why:** KPI達成可能性分析（v1/v2）で「許容すべき不確実性」としていた「コンテンツ数に比例してアルゴリズムの的中率が上がる」という前提の検証が必要。この前提が正しくない場合、KPI戦略全体の見直しが必要になる。

**What was done:**

- **`docs/ALGORITHM-CONTENT-VOLUME-ANALYSIS.md`** 新規作成（約600行、日本語）
  - 4プラットフォーム（YouTube Shorts / TikTok / Instagram Reels / X）の最新アルゴリズムを網羅的に調査
  - Buffer社1,140万投稿分析、Metricool社Reels年次比較、NexLev 9,414チャンネル分析等のデータソースを使用
  - 9セクション構成: エグゼクティブサマリー / 前提検証 / プラットフォーム別分析 / AI生成コンテンツのハンディキャップ / 成長曲線の数学モデル / ペナルティリスク / KPI前提への影響 / 推奨戦略 / 結論

**主要な発見:**

1. **「量 ∝ 的中率」は誤り** — 各コンテンツは独立に評価される。量は「宝くじの枚数」を増やすだけで、1枚あたりの当選確率は変わらない
2. **関係は対数的（logarithmic）** — TikTok 1,140万件分析: 投稿頻度を11倍にしても中央値視聴数は横ばい（489→459）
3. **品質が量を圧倒** — 完視聴率60%で1本/日 > 完視聴率20%で3本/日。全プラットフォームで70%以上の完視聴率がバイラルトリガー
4. **AI生成コンテンツの成功率: 0.2〜0.3%** — エンゲージメント率は人間の半分以下（1.8〜2.5% vs 4.1%）
5. **STRATEGY.mdのインプレッション想定は10〜100倍の過大評価** — 新規アカウント初月のTikTok中央値は489（想定15,000）

**KPI戦略への提言:** 「3,500アカウントの量産」→「少数の高品質アカウント育成 → 成功パターンの横展開」へのシフトを推奨

### 2026-02-13: Pipeline GUI E2E検証 & ドキュメント整合性修正

**Why:** 前回セッション（2026-02-12）で実装したPipeline GUI実行機能の実機検証と、ドキュメントの整合性確認・修正。

**E2Eテスト結果:**
- PM2ウォッチャー: 17時間稼働中、リスタート0回、エラーログ空
- Dry Run テスト: productionタブにテスト行を追加 → `queued_dry` 設定 → ウォッチャーが30秒以内に検出 → 全5ステップ完了（1秒）→ `dry_run_complete` に自動更新
- 発見した問題: motionsインベントリに `MOT_0001` のみ登録。`MOT_0002`/`MOT_0003` は存在せず、Row 2の既存データは再実行不可。これはデータ（人間のインベントリ登録）の問題であり、コードのバグではない。

**ドキュメント修正:**
- `OPERATIONS.md`: 最終更新日修正（2026-02-10→2026-02-13）、概要のパイプライン実行方法をGUI反映、motion IDの例をMOT_0001に統一（存在しないIDの例示を修正）
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: 最終更新日修正（2026-02-10→2026-02-13）
- `CONTEXT.md`: Files in Repositoryセクションに `PipelineUI.gs`, `watch-pipeline.js`, `ecosystem.config.js` 追加。テスト数を最新値に更新（GAS 343/10 suites, Pipeline 33/1 suite）

### 2026-02-13: script_language カラム追加 — EN/JP 動的スクリプト選択

**Why:** パイプラインが常に `script_en` を使用していたため、日本語アカウント（target_region=JP）でも英語音声しか生成できなかった。`script_language` カラムを追加し、production タブから動的に EN/JP を切り替えられるようにする。

**What was done:**

- **production タブ拡張** (32カラム → 33カラム):
  - 新カラム `script_language` を `voice_id` の後（#13）に挿入
  - 値: `en` または `jp`（パイプラインコードでは空の場合 `en` にフォールバック）
  - GAS バリデーションでは必須フィールドとして扱う（`PRODUCTION_REQUIRED_FIELDS` に追加）
  - 以降の全カラム番号が +1 シフト（`pipeline_status` が #13 → #14 等）

- **パイプラインコード変更**:
  - `production-manager.js`: HEADERS に `script_language` 追加（33カラム）
  - `inventory-reader.js`: `resolveProductionRow()` で `script_language` を読み取り、`en`/`jp` のバリデーション、`scriptLanguage` フィールドとして返却
  - `orchestrator.js`: ハードコードされた `script_en` → 動的な `script_${scriptLanguage}` に変更。`section.scenario[scriptKey]` でスクリプト取得

- **GAS 変更**:
  - `Config.gs`: `PRODUCTION_REQUIRED_FIELDS` に `script_language` 追加（9フィールド）

- **テスト追加** (33 → 36 pipeline tests):
  - Test: production-manager HEADERS が 33 カラムであること
  - Test: orchestrator が動的 `scriptKey` パターンを使用すること
  - Test: inventory-reader が `script_language` を `en`/`jp` でバリデーションすること

- **ドキュメント更新**:
  - README.md: production タブスキーマに script_language 追加、カラム番号再採番、32→33
  - ARCHITECTURE.md: 32→33カラム、TTS説明に script_language 選択を追記
  - OPERATIONS.md: シナリオ説明・制作行テーブルに script_language 追加
  - account-design-guide.md: 地域×言語テーブル・production行テーブルに script_language 追加
  - STRATEGY.md, KPI-FEASIBILITY-ANALYSIS.md: 32→33カラム

**Files changed:**
- Modified: `pipeline/orchestrator.js`, `pipeline/sheets/inventory-reader.js`, `pipeline/sheets/production-manager.js`, `gas/Config.gs`
- Modified (tests): `tests/pipeline.test.js`, `gas/tests/setup.js`, `gas/tests/PipelineUI.test.js`
- Modified (docs): `README.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/STRATEGY.md`, `docs/manuals/OPERATIONS.md`, `docs/manuals/account-design-guide.md`, `docs/KPI-FEASIBILITY-ANALYSIS.md`

**Test results:** 379 tests passing (343 GAS / 10 suites + 36 pipeline / 1 suite)

### 2026-02-13: インベントリキャッシュ修正 — 毎ポーリング最新取得

**Why:** watch-pipeline.js がインベントリデータをプロセス起動時に1回だけキャッシュし、以降は再読み込みしなかった。そのため、インベントリシートに新しいコンポーネント（モーション、シナリオ、キャラクター）を追加しても、watcher を再起動しない限り反映されなかった。

**What was done:**

- `scripts/watch-pipeline.js`: `clearCache` を import に追加、`pollOnce()` の先頭で毎回 `clearCache()` を呼び出し
- これにより毎ポーリング（30秒ごと）に motions/scenarios/characters の3インベントリキャッシュがクリアされ、`resolveProductionRow()` 実行時に各インベントリシートから最新データを取得

**影響:**
- 今後はインベントリシートにコンポーネントを追加した際、watcher 再起動不要で自動的に反映される
- Google Sheets API の呼び出し回数は増加するが、ポーリング間隔（30秒）で十分なレート内
